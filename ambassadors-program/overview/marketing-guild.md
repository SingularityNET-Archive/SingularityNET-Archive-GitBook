Overview: We now have a monthly budget allocation currently set to 7,500 AGIX per month.

During last week's discussion we chatted and worked on setting up Tasks on the Dework page. We've created a Marketing Guild section and have posted a few Tasks for those interested:

* Ambassador Weekly Meeting Infographic (up to 5 participants)
* Curate a Task
* Join the YouTube Editing Workshop

What we learned during the meeting was that some people would like more structured tasks within the Dework page. This is something Marketing Guild will work towards.

I encourage everyone to join the conversation within the Marketing Guild portion of the Ambassador Program within the SingularityNET Discord.

## November 25th 2022. Marketing Guild Meeting

Alright, Marketing Guild meets up today, Friday the 25th @ 13UTC. Bring your thoughts and ideas.

* Community Podcast meets at 14UTC right after if anyone wants to join.

Here's some notes / stuff to talk about:

Twitter unlocked as of yesterday and I changed the handle to @SNET\_Ambassador.

* Any thoughts on a better handle? We could use the same handle on the YouTube and other socials.
* Who is interested on being on the TweetDeck?

Weekly Townhall - anyone want to take over learning how to edit the video? We could add the same intro etc on all the videos we post.

Projects on the AI Marketplace could use write ups / blog posts / video content based around them.

Infographics about the ecosystem. A great starter would be an Ambassador Program flyer with our current schedule (ie Podcast, Townhall, Treasury, Marketing)

I wasn't able to attend the Treasury meeting this week due to holiday - we need to figure out our budget.

There's an interest form for the Ambassador Program. By Q1 2023 we should put together an email outlining some basic info, our schedule, and onboarding process to send out for the Ambassador Program.

To-Do: -Decide on a handle (or settle for SNET\_Ambassador) -Get Twitter going, find people that want to contribute, add to Tweetdeck, discuss posting guidelines -Weekly video editing and posting on the Ambassador YouTube -Plenty of potential for write ups, blogs, and videos on the ecosystem and Ambassador Program.

## November 4, 2022. Marketing Guild Meeting 1

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/sRqxB1hI68U" %}

Overview: We had a nice overview conversation starting with social media which pivoted into the broader scope of marketing.

Our discussion pondered posting educational content as well as updates about the Ambassador Program on various socials.

A piece of the conversation was Twitter with future possibilities including hosting or helping out with Spaces in the SingularityNET ecosystem.

We're looking for people interested in social media, video editing, writing, and content creation. All ideas are welcome.&#x20;

To-Do / Goals:

* Post Ambassador Program updates to social media sites weekly beginning with Twitter and YouTube, while looking to branch out to Reddit, YouTube alternatives, etc.
* ponder a handle we would like to use across our socials and create an overall cohesiveness between socials
