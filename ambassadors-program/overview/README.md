# Overview

The SingularityNET Ambassador Program is dedicated to growing awareness of the importance of decentralized AI/AGI and the SingularityNET ecosystem. Through the program, we aim to provide structure and rewards to community members who are committed to contributing towards a beneficial AGI. For background information on the SingularityNET Ecosystem, see https://singularitynet.io/ecosystem.

Our main drivers are transparency, decentralization, and involvement. To uphold these values, community members are fully involved in decision-making processes, including how tokens are spent. This is achieved through regular Town Hall meetings, which are open and accessible to all members of the community.

Together, we can work towards creating a world where AGI benefits all of humanity.
