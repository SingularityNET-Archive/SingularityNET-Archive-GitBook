## Saturday 1st February 2025

### Gamers Guild

- **Type of meeting:** Biweekly
- **Present:** Slate [**facilitator**], devon [**documenter**], malik, rebel, AshleyDawn, lord kizzy, Kateri, Gorga Siagian, hotasiro, Tevo, martinsoki, photogee, Slate
- **Purpose:** The purpose of this Gamers Guild meeting was to review the progress of ongoing Roblox projects, outline the selection process for new map creators, discuss upcoming research tasks for alternative metaverse platforms, and consider a potential chess tournament initiative.
- **Working Docs:**

#### Discussion Points:
- Map Creators’ Progress:

Gorga & Kateri showcased the near-complete city map, emphasizing realism in road layouts, building placements, and scripts.
Slate suggested adding small roads or pathways between repeating apartment blocks for improved visual separation.
SLates plans to hold a follow-up call with Gorga and Kateri to finalize outstanding details (e.g., floating buildings, potential airport redesign).
- Map Creators Selection Process (Slate):

The Gamers Guild is seeking four additional map creators: two for the Ambassador University area and two for the river/water zone.
Interested members must submit small, realistic builds or models for review.
Final selections will be made by the end of February, based on realism, quality, and adherence to game standards.
- Education Guild Updates:

Malik showcased improved animations, dialogue systems, and NPC interactions (e.g., “Headelf” NPC, “Lord Kizzy” rig in the classroom, “Hufi Umar” building robots).
- Realistic Asset Experience:

Slate demonstrated a Roblox “asset library” containing high-quality 3D models, textures, wind-influenced trees, futuristic furniture, and shops.
Creators can request access and copy-paste these ready-to-use assets into their own builds, streamlining development while maintaining visual consistency.
- Research Task on Metaverse Platforms:

Malik and Gorga volunteered to investigate Decentraland and The Sandbox, respectively, exploring feasibility, user-friendliness, and costs.
Findings will help determine potential Gamers Guild expansions beyond Roblox; final research is expected by end of February.
- Chess Tournament Proposal:

Malik suggested a casual or structured chess event, potentially collaborating with Marketing Guild for broader community involvement.
Possible formats include traditional 1v1 or “Hand and Brain” team play. Feasibility and scheduling require further planning.
