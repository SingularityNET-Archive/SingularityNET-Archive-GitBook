#### Agenda Items:
- Which WGs are represented on the call?
- WG minimum budgets 
- Increasingly late meeting start times 
- Archives will not be checking meeting summaries in Q2 2025 
- What WG Sync calls should be about (results of Googleform)
- Ambassador Program End of Year Report 2024
- WGs that are not taking part?  
- MeTTa Coders Lab initiative 

#### Discussion:
1) Workgroups represented on the call: We asked in Chat and found the following groups are present
- Archives
- AI Ethics
- Onboarding
- Translation
- Writers
- Marketing
- R & D
- Moderators
- African Guild
- Governance
- Sandbox/Think Tank


2) WG minimum budgets - How to progress discussion on the idea, proposed in the "budget caps for Q2" discussion doc https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kVd_4Ih-lSdMoIcmVeOS3_H3aqOdnMmMG6o1WqGTx1w/edit?usp=sharing , that WGs should determine their minimum budgets - it was decided that Governance WG is the best place for this conversation, and that we should not actually discuss it in this meeting.

2) Increasingly late meeting start times: We recognised that it's difficult to fix without putting people off turning up at all. Suggestions included:
- If you're late, your participation will not be counted (but most people would not mind that);
- Start meetings at 5 mins past, regardless of who's present - of course this can't be enforced on WGs, but we could suggest it, and try it out in e.g. Governance, Town Hall, etc.

3) Archives WG will not be checking meeting summaries during Q2 - Meeting summaries are often inaccurate or garbled, and it is a lot of overhead to check and correct them. So for budget reasons *and* experimental reasons, Archives will stop doing this during Q2, and will simply approve and archive whatever is submitted. They will then test whether the graph RAG process they are developing is able to "fill in the gaps" and derive meaningful and accurate information from summaries in Q2. If yes, it will be helpful to know that our archiving system doesn't require accurate summaries; and if no, we can assess what kinds of errors matter.

4) Googleform responses on what WG Sync calls should cover: see https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DYQb3U4AkXsxtOl7uHONFtfBkavicU1wleJskQKf5Ms/edit?usp=sharing There were 5 responses, all quite different. Key points:

- Some issues with not knowing when the call is (we need to keep publicising it)

- Best uses of time include cross-WG collaborations; feedback, evaluation, and knowledge sharing; top-level planning, and assigning relevant people to go off and discuss issues in more detail; external speakers. 

- There was a suggestion of using the call for progress updates, but this was felt to be very similar to the monthly "WG Updates" Town Hall, so perhaps not useful.

- Should NOT be used for: Grievances/conflict resolution (we note that there is a process in place for that, see https://docs.google.com/document/d/1beMEt9XmPvHNaH08Rh5_taTI0QhHcyy15Q6XcXXDWUI/edit?usp=sharing , though it has never been used); Personal ideas; Decisionmaking and detailed planning; Issues that belong in Governance meetings. Note that some people in the meeting disagreed with some of these.

- Future wishes for the calls - several of these have already started to be done; the idea of expert training sessions in the call itself, and followup discussion afterwards, remains to be discussed. We note that a previous Governance session (9th Jan 2025, https://snet-ambassadors.gitbook.io/singularitynet-archive/timeline/2025/january-2025/week-2#governance-workgroup-1) discussed how to encourage attendance from all WGs - there was a suggestion of rewards from Program reserves for WGs that attended all 3 meetings in a Quarter; although we noted that given current token price, this might not be something we still want to do. Nevertheless, we have recorded which WGs were present.

5) End of Year Report 2024 - we agreed a final date of Sunday 9th March to finish the report https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TxKxP9sDNgvKncAqO0F-UhZgoftMdDktaqbt50-h2XM/edit?usp=sharing, and WGs who have not added material will do so by Fri 7th to allow time for a final proofread. We also noticed that several WGs (Education, Gamers, Strategy) have not added material *and* have not been coming to WG Sync calls - are they feeling excluded or disengaged in any way, or facing barriers? We did not reach conclusions on how or whether to ask them.

6) MeTTa Coder Lab: This is intended as a "low-barrier-to-entry" way for people to learn MeTTa, and was originally a proposal in an RFP funding round, but was unsuccessful - so Guillermo is suggesting it as a cross-WG collaboration - education+ RND + AI SANDBOX +Onboarding plus any others who want to.  The proposal and other materials were shared and comments were invited. There will be meetings soon to discuss the collaboration and how to fund it. 


#### Decision Items:
- We will continue to publicise the WG Sync calls, and the agenda, in Discord - maybe a little further in advance than we have been doing.
  - [**rationale**] Because the survey indicated that some people are not aware when the call is, or what is on the agenda
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- RE late start to meetings: we will try starting calls such as Governance WG, Town Hall, etc no later than 5 minutes in, regardless of who is present, rather than waiting; and will publicise that we will be doing this. Then in the next WG Sync we will discuss whether it has helped.
  - [**rationale**] to see if it helps encourage people to arrive on time
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- The question of how to approach WG budget minimums will be taken up in Governance WG
  - [**rationale**] because this call (WG Sync) doesn't feel like the best place for it due to time constraints
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We agreed we will continue to capture which WGs are represented at the WG Sync Calls, but will decide at the end of the Quarter whether we want to go ahead with rewarding WGs who attend all 3 sessions, as agreed in Open Governance meeting on 9th Jan 2025 https://snet-ambassadors.gitbook.io/singularitynet-archive/timeline/2025/january-2025/week-2#governance-workgroup-1
  - [**rationale**] Due to low token price
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- Ambassador Program End of Year Report 2024 to be finished by end of day, Sunday 9th March. Anything not added by then, will not be used
  - [**rationale**] Because it is now well into 2025, so we need to finish it off
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople

- [**action**] All to add comments on the MeTTa Coder Lab program doc #01 _ Agenda Items MCLab _ 250225 [**assignee**] all [**due**] 4 March 2025 [**status**] todo

#### Narrative:
Intro: The weekly meeting of the African guild kicked off at 5:07 pm with a welcoming greeting from Duke. Before we began the meeting proper, Duke asked everyone how they’ve been and what they’ve been up to lately. Some members spoke about a few things they’ve been working on. We also looked at the summary note from the last meeting, and everything looks good. However, Duke encourages documenters to always submit their summary promptly; he also emphasized the need for a standard font across all documentation. 

Q1 Marketing Initiatives: Ese Williams shared an update on the progress of the Q1 marketing initiative spearheaded by Ayo, Lady Tempestt, CJ, and her humble self. She hinted that the content outline/script for the first video was ready! She added that the shooting will commence soon. She also talked about shooting the video at Badagry (because it has African heritage and culture). “Once the video is shot and edited, it will be published on all the social media platforms, Ese.” Duke encouraged the team to hasten their work because Q1 is almost drawing to a close.

Updates on the Ethiopian Trip: Clement shares his experience and thoughts about his trip to Ethiopia 🇪🇹 with Advance Amayaw, “It was quite interesting and unique. The event was held in Addis Ababa, where they interacted with individuals from other ecosystems, developers, and community managers. We also established partnerships, which will impact the African guild—Clement.” He also added that they engaged with African developers and some AI enthusiasts (students), and they spread the word about Deep Funding. Clement also said that it wasn’t easy for him and Advance to adapt to the Ethiopian dishes. 

Education and Translation Initiative: Clement gave a heads-up about these initiatives, hinting that the team is progressing towards making the series for the video content, and as a result, a video editor is needed. Thankfully, Eae showed interest in making the video! He spoke about how the initiative is poised to educate people about AI. For example, how AI can help farmers talk to the sky. Clement also mentioned that the video series will be hosted on GitHub for anyone to access. A few weeks ago, we talked about how we could set up a website and also host the series on learning platforms like Udemy. However, the token price has made us put a hold on that. 

Content Calendar: Advance Amayaw showcased a document in the meeting that highlights the collaborative efforts of all workgroups in the Ambassador Program. Its primary purpose is to coordinate social media content ideas, schedules, and updates. The goal is to ensure that all workgroups follow brand guidelines when creating content (graphics, videos, etc.) and to provide feedback and approvals on drafted posts to maintain quality and brand alignment.

Budget: As Q1 2025 draws to a close, the drafting of the Q2 budget has begun. Duke mentioned that the African Guild is reviving the Members Collective—an initiative that allows guild members to propose ideas for bootstrapping marketing efforts and expanding SNET’s reach across borders. The meeting concluded with Duke encouraging members to submit their proposals in hopes of securing funding to get the job done.

Highlights/Upcoming Events: Be on the lookout for phase 2 of the Ubuntu and AI series, as well as the marketing and translation initiatives and hackathon. As a matter of finality, the new people introduced themselves to the house; Alfred thanked the Duke for the warm welcome.
