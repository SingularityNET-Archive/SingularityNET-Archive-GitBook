#### Narrative:
We signed off Guillermo's infographics for the Q2 decision, and discussed how best to share them and what relevant links should be posted with them.

We agreed on an exchange rate of $0.30 for Q2 2025 budgets

We provisionally agreed the Q2 2025 budget for GovWG, pending any rethinks before the submission date of 10th March. We looked at the WG task sheet, and what surplus we have; and we discussed briefly whether we can still afford to continue with backlog documentation, or whether we should simply record "No summary given" for uncompleted summaries - to be discussed

We discussed whether and how to implement the ideas around WG minimum budgets suggested in the “Budget caps for Q2” discussion doc https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kVd_4Ih-lSdMoIcmVeOS3_H3aqOdnMmMG6o1WqGTx1w/edit?usp=sharing. We decided yes, we should discuss how different WGs might approach decising on their operational minimum and what would be included in it, and that the next WG sync call would be a good place to start; so we added it to the WG Sync Call rolling agenda.


#### Discussion Points:
-  Agreeing publicity and infographics for the Q2 budget process
- Agreeing exchange rate for Q2 budgets
- Agreeing draft GovWG budget for Q2 2025
- Minimum WG budgets

#### Decision Items:
- We signed off Guillermo's infographics for the Q2 2025 budget process, pending a couple of small changes (e.g. adding the agreed exchange rate)
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We agreed that Peter and Vani will both post the infographics; and that when the timeline and/or the "Take part in governance" infographics are posted, the post will include a link to the list of Core Contributors, and the context-setting doc for Core Contributors; 
and the "Submit your WG budgets" will be posted together with links to the Budget Planner, the Budget Caps spreadsheet, and the context-stetting doc for WGs
  - [**rationale**] to ensure that people can easily find the info they need
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We agreed the exchange rate for Q2 budgets will be $0.30
  - [**rationale**] because the rate  in recent days has been under $0.35 and falling; and because, for WG budget management, it would be preferable to set it too low than too high
  - [**opposing**] $0.35 was also suggested, but the majority preferred $0.30
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We provisionally agreed the  draft Q2 budget for Gov WG, including taking c. $800 from reserves to cover elements that we cannot otherwise afford. Changes can still be made up until the submission date of 10th March.
  - [**rationale**] Token price being low, we will need to take from reserves in order to be able to do any additional sessions (e.g. a retrospective, as we always do) and to cover content creation such as infographics. We might not spend all of what we plan to take from our reserves.
  - [**opposing**] Some concerns were raised about the fact that doing this could mean we go in to Q3 2025 with no WG reserves
  - [**effect**] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- We agreed that the idea of WG minimum budgets should be discussed in the next WG sync call; covering how different WGs approach deciding on their operational minimum budgets, and what would be included in a minimum for different WGs. We added this to the WG Sync Call rolling agenda.
