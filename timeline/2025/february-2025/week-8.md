#### Narrative:
We signed off Guillermo's infographics for the Q2 decision, and discussed how best to share them and what relevant links should be posted with them.

We agreed on an exchange rate of $0.30 for Q2 2025 budgets

We provisionally agreed the Q2 2025 budget for GovWG, pending any rethinks before the submission date of 10th March. We looked at the WG task sheet, and what surplus we have; and we discussed briefly whether we can still afford to continue with backlog documentation, or whether we should simply record "No summary given" for uncompleted summaries - to be discussed

We discussed whether and how to implement the ideas around WG minimum budgets suggested in the “Budget caps for Q2” discussion doc https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kVd_4Ih-lSdMoIcmVeOS3_H3aqOdnMmMG6o1WqGTx1w/edit?usp=sharing. We decided yes, we should discuss how different WGs might approach decising on their operational minimum and what would be included in it, and that the next WG sync call would be a good place to start; so we added it to the WG Sync Call rolling agenda.


#### Discussion Points:
-  Agreeing publicity and infographics for the Q2 budget process
- Agreeing exchange rate for Q2 budgets
- Agreeing draft GovWG budget for Q2 2025
- Minimum WG budgets

#### Decision Items:
- We signed off Guillermo's infographics for the Q2 2025 budget process, pending a couple of small changes (e.g. adding the agreed exchange rate)
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We agreed that Peter and Vani will both post the infographics; and that when the timeline and/or the "Take part in governance" infographics are posted, the post will include a link to the list of Core Contributors, and the context-setting doc for Core Contributors; 
and the "Submit your WG budgets" will be posted together with links to the Budget Planner, the Budget Caps spreadsheet, and the context-stetting doc for WGs
  - [**rationale**] to ensure that people can easily find the info they need
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We agreed the exchange rate for Q2 budgets will be $0.30
  - [**rationale**] because the rate  in recent days has been under $0.35 and falling; and because, for WG budget management, it would be preferable to set it too low than too high
  - [**opposing**] $0.35 was also suggested, but the majority preferred $0.30
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We provisionally agreed the  draft Q2 budget for Gov WG, including taking c. $800 from reserves to cover elements that we cannot otherwise afford. Changes can still be made up until the submission date of 10th March.
  - [**rationale**] Token price being low, we will need to take from reserves in order to be able to do any additional sessions (e.g. a retrospective, as we always do) and to cover content creation such as infographics. We might not spend all of what we plan to take from our reserves.
  - [**opposing**] Some concerns were raised about the fact that doing this could mean we go in to Q3 2025 with no WG reserves
  - [**effect**] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- We agreed that the idea of WG minimum budgets should be discussed in the next WG sync call; covering how different WGs approach deciding on their operational minimum budgets, and what would be included in a minimum for different WGs. We added this to the WG Sync Call rolling agenda.
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople

#### Action Items:
- [**action**] Vani and Peter to share Guillermo's infographics regularly over the next few weeks, together with links to relevant docs [**assignee**] CallyFromAuron, PeterE [**due**] 10 March 2025 [**status**] todo

### Governance Workgroup

- **Type of meeting:** Weekly
- **Present:** PeterE [**facilitator**], martinsoki, CallyFromAuron [**documenter**], PeterE, CallyFromAuron, AshleyDawn, guillermolucero, martinsoki, LordKizzy, LadyTempestt, Effiom, advanceameyaw, Évéline Trinité
- **Purpose:** Weekly Open Governance meeting
- **Working Docs:**
  - [Governance calls, rolling agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t39dwlwLYYB_1z_5szq1rnOH7mVTHe8Tmwv0R6ELOyE/edit?usp=sharing)
  - [“Budget caps for Q2” discussion](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kVd_4Ih-lSdMoIcmVeOS3_H3aqOdnMmMG6o1WqGTx1w/edit?usp=sharing)
  - [Ambassador Program Budget Planner](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BBogj9rAO52cpdGP3uvp8hAHNa4Qw66lz9JLjSC2yVs/edit?usp=sharing)
  - [Ambassador Program Core Contributors criteria](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13uPKVnooFowpoxRBZJH71iIbHUyoOokdn_RCDvp_RHI/edit?usp=sharing)

#### Narrative:
We noted that in Q1, Process Guild voluntarily gave up 1,000 AGIX to help with budget fitting (reducing their cap from 2,000 to 1,000); so this should be restored in Q2. Since we have already said that budget caps will remain the same this Quarter as they were in Q1, the only way to do this is to give Process Guild 1,000 AGIX from Program reserves.
We also agreed that we definitely need to reassess budget caps for Q3; and that this should be done in the light of the discussion on minimum budgets (the minimum a WG needs in order to operate).

Anonymity: 
Peter noted that it can be difficult to resolve objections when the objectors are not present in the meeting and prepared to "un-anonymise" themselves. 

Vani said it can be difficult to raise concerns - especially serious, "whistle-blowing" type concenrns - without anonymity. How will we make sure the space feels safe to raise things?

We recapped the point made in the previous meeting that the process is *not* anonymous now, because anyone with access to the Ambassador Gmail account can see who said what - but it's not clear if people fully realise that.

LordKizzy confirmed that the Governance dashboard being developed in R&D Guild will keep user identities anonymous to the public, but admins will still have access to this information - this raises the question of who should be an admin. 

LadyTempestt stated that she doesn't feel OK raising issues in the budget consent forms ever since she found out that it is not confidential, so she just abstains. 

We noted that it would be possible to create the consent forms on a different Google account that only 1 person has access to (perhaps Peter, given his particular role in the ecosystem). 

Guillermo said that a non-anonymous consent process can foster a stronger community. When you fear to give your opinion whatever it is, it's not good - raising concerns openly will improve our professional relationships and help us learn to accept criticism. The planned Governance dashboard hopes to address this, and to make it easier for people to raise concerns transparently. 
Vani said that while this *can* work, sometimes lack of anonymity means people give less honest feedback; so we get an apparent "consensus" that isn't real. Also, any negative effects of removing anonymity are likely to fall more heavily on those who are already marginalized, or who feel the least confident or the least safe.
Guillermo countered that having anonymity can make it more likely that people will raise unfair or nonsense concerns.
Kizzy pointed out that if people do not attend the discussion meetings, they don't know that their concern has been resolved, and will raise it again next time, so we go round in circles.
Guillermo suggested we could make it an option when the new Governance dashboard is built - people could choose whether or not they want to be anonymous.
Vani referenced a previous Governance meeting where it was suggested that we need an independent person or group who maintain oversight, but are not otherwise involved in budget decisions, and are neutral. It was agreed back then that it would be difficult to find such a person

We noted that by the end of Q2, the Governance dashboard should be ready, and this might change things - so this Quarter might be the only chance we get to try out a non-anonymous consent process and see how it goes.

We checked the new sheet for Q2 which LordKizzy has added to the Budget Planner, and agreed the additions he needed to make to it.


#### Discussion Points:
- Process Guild's budget cap for Q2 2025
- Need to reassess budget caps for Q3
- Anonymity in decision-making
- New Q2 sheet in the Budget Planner

#### Decision Items:
- We decided to add 1,000 AGIX from Program Reserves to Process Guild's Q2 budget cap
  - [**rationale**] because Process Guild agreed last Quarter to voluntarily give up 1,000 AGIX to help with budget-fitting, but this was only ever intended as a temporary measure. When we agreed in a previous meeting that budget caps should stay the same as they were for Q1, we forgot about this.
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We agreed that we will reassess / recalculate the budget caps for Q3, and will do it in the light of discussion of WG budget minimums
  - [**rationale**] Several WGs are unhappy with their caps; and we cannot continue to "top up" Process Guild from reserves indefinitely; so there needs to be an adjustment; and we need to ensure that minimums are covered.
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We agreed to continue the discussion on anonymity next meeting.
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople

#### Discussion Points:
- LordKizzy began the meeting by welcoming everyone and reviewing the last meeting summary. LordKizzy went through Eric Davis document and gave update on the Zealy initiative progress report, indicating it is nearing completion with significant growth and massive increase in participation. Specifically, he developed two models, each containing 10 tags, which have been successfully uploaded to the Zealy board.
- Photogee gave an update on the Podcast initiative. He noted that he collaborated with Kenichi concerning this and has received feedback from 6 people and the response was evenly distributed, two people for writers, two people for audio and visual specialist, and two people as producer and host. Which is going to be two two per month, two episodes for each month. They are going to test run one episode first. Kenichi brought up a suggestion on creating a general form with three sections of questions.The first episode is intended to serve as a learning experience, with Peter suggesting that initial episodes would help attract more guests. LordKizzy acknowledged that there shouldn't be an extra allocation for the operation for the initiative team because there is already an allocation for the initiative team in our budget. He also noted that people working on this podcast are working outside their scope but they are working within their scope.
- Kareem presented his proposal on the design workgroup initiative under marketing guild. He stated that the budget of the design workgroup will come from the marketing guild. However, Lord kizzy stated that currently our budget is low and even with our reserves we can’t still fund the proposal.  
- Mikasa gave update on the Social media management and contributor spotlight. Which stated that the contributor Spotlight is not out yet but hopefully it will be out today. Also, the Twitter account already has the Premium Plus.  
- Graphics Team:
Gorga stated he has made the design for the contributor Spotlight and he has changed the background, with the design of the Town Hall call announcement, the design of the Weekly meeting schedule in two languages, namely English and French, then the design of the AI sandbox related to the Think-tank debate and the design for the Writers workgroup related to the ecosystem page article, the community page, the post for the X trip, and the design of the monthly Twitter article post.
- Kareem to give update on graphics. He stated that he has been reviewing designs making sure they meet up to the standards, and he has been working on the comic initiative, also, a couple of templates that will be used across the quarter.
- Budget and task management:
LordKizzy said he's currently drafting out the Q1 report and Q2 budget proposal for the Guild. we are actually going to have to make new cuts because of the token price. Hopefully by next he would present it so we can have a discussion around it.
- Kenichi said based on the Marketing Guild Survey they have been getting more submissions on that. He stated that People have asked a lot of questions about the Ambassador program. There's not enough information about the Ambassador program out there. He plans on sharing links to the responses he received.
- Community initiative review team
LordKizzy and Kenichi had a call on Saturday whereby they looked at the responses from the community initiatives and also analyzed it before sending it to Ayo, so that they can get feedback from him. So that they can start reaching out to the selected members that got selected, so that they can make some necessary corrections for those that need to.
- Kateri stated regarding the Community Spotlight, she has sent it across to Mikasa to post it. Guild Spotlights. She created the questionnaire and sent it to R&D Guild, which Guillermo told her that before the meeting, he would have responded to her.
