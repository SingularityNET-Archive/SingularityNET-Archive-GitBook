#### Narrative:
Low attendance at first, but people drifted in gradually.

We assigned some tasks RE the Q2 budget decision (publicity and context-setting material, admin such as drafting consent form, plus this WG's own budget and Q1 2025 report)

We discussed what context-setting material is needed, and realised that we need material aimed at WGs to help them formulate their reports and budgets, as well as https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fyZZLDqeeoDanbzyY7c9m7sy_hU5w9v5niuR4m521ms/edit?usp=sharing which is aimed at Core Contributors to inform them about the consent process.

We discussed how to fit the GovWG budget to our budget cap. We noted that because we have been operating close to the minimum level of activity that would be meaningful for the WG, there is not much room to make cuts. We are unwilling to reduce meetings, or to rely on Peter (who doesn't take payment) facilitating all meetings. 
We also noted that this discussion has a bearing on the question of WG minimum budgets, as outlined in the “Budget caps for Q2” discussion doc here https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kVd_4Ih-lSdMoIcmVeOS3_H3aqOdnMmMG6o1WqGTx1w/edit?usp=sharing
and we noted that the approach we decided on (using WG reserves to cover any shortfall, and stating on our budget sheet which items will be covered this way) is a useful approach and should be included in the guidance we are writing for other WGs.

We briefly discussed the 'DRAFT process for how to use the "New Ideas" budget' doc, but noted that there was not time to fully cover the issue. We briefly discussed the merits of a voting process versus a consent process for agreeing proposals to use the New Ideas budget. We agreed the proposed process will be finalised in the next Governance meeting on Thurs 13th Feb; and once finalised, it will be submitted as a Treasury Policy.



#### Discussion Points:
-  Publicity materials for Q2 2025 budget submission and decision process
- Context-setting materials for the Q2 2025 budget process
- Automation of process of calculating who is a Core Contributor

- How to make cuts to the GovWG budget, and using WG reserves to cover any shortfall
- Creating policy on how to use the New Ideas budget

- 


#### Decision Items:
- We agreed to write a context-setting doc for WGs giving guidance on writing their Q1 reports and Q2 budgets, It will be advisory only at this stage, and should suggest that: 
1) any WG that is unhappy with its budget cap should address this in its Q1 report, and demonstrate why they need more
2) WGs should show in their budgets anything that they intend to take from their WG reserves
3) Where relevant, WGs should include some sort of changelog from their previous Quarter's budget to show what they have changed.

  - [**rationale**] Because these things have emerged from Governance discussions over the Quarter, and we need to ensure all WGs are aware of them.
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We agreed to cover any shortfall in our own Q2 budget by taking from our WG reserves
  - [**rationale**] Beause this is preferable to reducing the number of meetings, reducing payment for e.g. faciliattion and documentation (which, at $20, is already quite low compared to other WGs) or relying on Peter to facilitate all meetings.
- We agreed to finalise the process for using the New Ideas budget in the next meeting (Thurs 13th Feb), and then submit it as a Treasury Policy
  - [**rationale**] so that it can be formally ratified, or not, using the established Treasury Policy process
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- As already agreed in a previous meeting, we confirmed that Core Contributor Criteria have been slightly changed 
  - [**rationale**] to make time recognition stricter, and contribution cost reduced to a fixed 300 USD instead of 1,000 AGIX (to account for token price fluctuation)
