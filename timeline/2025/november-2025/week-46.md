#### Town Hall Summary:
Low attendance at Town Hall this week, so not really valid to discuss the planned restructure of the Ambassador Program - need more people.

Should we aim to meet with Deepfunding and with Rejuve before year end, or in January? Probably January.

Mentioned idea of an end of year report, taking material from people's impact statements in their minimal Q4 reports in the Governance dashboard

Current positives and negatives for the Program:
- It is not a typical Ambassador program - could be an advantage. 
- It's often isolated from other parts of the sNET ecosysttem - can be problematic
- Redundancy/duplication of work - although we want to maintain variety of approaches, present low token price means we need to minimise overlap with different WGs doing similar, and maximise collaboration?
- 

Recent sentiment survey perhaps identifies high-performing groups?

People are dropping out and the Program is smaller than it was. Should we be trying to conduct some kind of exit interviews? Could be difficult to get people to take part - once they've gone, they're gone

Issues around calculating core contributor status - who is actually active, rather than merely present?


#### Keywords/tags:
- **topics covered:** low token price, sentiment survey, participation, contribution, Core Contributors , wider sNET ecosystem, Deep Funding, Rejuve, Ambassador Program restructure, Meeting attendance, EOY report 2025
- **emotions:** quiet, low attendance, reflective, gloomy

## Thursday 13th November 2025

### Governance Workgroup

- **Type of meeting:** Weekly
- **Present:** CallyFromAuron [**facilitator**], CallyFromAuron, all (collaborative documentation) [**documenter**], CallyFromAuron, PeterE, omolola, Alfred Itodele, Kateri, guillermolucero, ayomi shuga, martinsoki, sharmila
- **Purpose:** regular weekly Open Governance session
- **Working Docs:**
  - [Demo "invisible work" log](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MD6V9PbW-h7OwqEj3kdVgf27RaQfr4G6v4gH67Ya2io/edit?usp=sharing)
  - [Draft "Invisible work hero" nomination form](https://forms.gle/aujqzYv4SpkisPEt5)
  - [collaborative documentation notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10A9fiukKe_Da6LXD8qcnp5dLOjtbTpVIZ6ZehYoVsvA/edit?usp=sharing)

#### Narrative:
TOPIC: What is "work", and how do we recognise and value the invisible work we all do

1) What does this community value as "work"?  What do we / don't we count, and why?

- participating in governance, monthly WG updates, Town Hall, etc are invisible work
- R&D decided to reward otherwise invisible work on Gov-Dash - the off-record discussions and async chats. A lot of this kind of work we don’t even track the time. Tevo did similar in Treasury
- "Emotional Housework" is pretty much always invisible
- Support for new members and mentoring to tasks
- Small micro-efforts - reminding people about stuff, posting reminders, that makes stuff work. Too small to put on Dework
- Attending WG calls could be work right - but is attendance the same as participation? Participation over presence
- Filing out surveys or consent forms
- Things that people pay out of their own pockets - tooling etc (and paying tourist dollar rate on credit card!) Need to update lists of what paid accounts the program has and what individuals are paying for.



2) What's paid, and what's voluntary? How do we decide?

- We prioritise tech tasks over admin, emotional, community - perhaps we shouldn't
- Lots of WGs are doing operations with no rewards - keep outcomes and scope, but rewards have dropped 70% of our work became invisible... LatAm; Onboarding; Archives; all have done this But tracking it still, so can reward it if price goes back up
- Should we pay everything? Does it change the nature of it (e.g. giving someone emotional support)  if it becomes a transaction?



3) How do we count and record the voluntary bits? 
- Vani shared demo “invisible work” log - could everyine do this?
- Important to keep overheads minimal - if it takes more effort to log than to do, it's not good. So keep it as rough estimates
- we do need to know WHAT it was
- It’s all equivalent
- For now, no need to check - it’s an honour system (or maybe check very clear outliers but that’s it). But maybe it becomes an issue if it feeds into a reputation system

- We also shared Draft “invisible work hero” nomination form https://forms.gle/aujqzYv4SpkisPEt5  
- It's not competitive - anyone who is nominated gets added to Dework and gets task points.
- People liked this idea. 
- Maybe nomination could eventually lead to a bonus??
- Are there ways we can reward work other than money/tokens? To be further discussed








#### Discussion Points:
- What does this community value as "work"?  What do we / don;t we count, and why?
- What's paid, and what's voluntary? How do we decide?
- How do we count and record the voluntary bits?

#### Decision Items:
- We will start by implemeting the "Invisible Work Hero" form 
  - [**rationale**] feels like an interesting way to start capturing hidden work
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We can also implement the spreadheet to record invisible work for those who want, although there was less enthusiasm for this
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople

#### Action Items:
- [**action**] Vani and Peter will be happy to add the results to Dework [**assignee**] CallyFromAuron, PeterE [**due**] 12 December 2025 [**status**] todo

#### Keywords/tags:
- **topics covered:** invisible work, volunteer work, emotional housework, token price, we used collaborative documentation
- **emotions:** thoughtful,  Collaborative, Interesting, sad, surprising, realisation of how much we all do
