#### Town Hall Summary:
Very low attendance at last week's TH - only Peter, Vani, and Scott Forshaw from Toridian. We briefly discussed ways to increase engagement and attendance, recognised that low attendance might be a result of low token price.

Colleen shared her efforts to connect Scott with Rafael at Deep Funding, and addressed the challenges of managing numerous connection requests. 

Need for input from all workgroups for the upcoming WG sync call, particularly regarding core activities for 2026.

Updates included 
- Colleen's proposal for the Cudos accelerator program, and her work on a roadmap incorporating new ideas
- idea of a meeting between the Ambassador Program and Rejuve (first mooted during the recent AMA with Jasmine Smith organised by Onboarding WG and Education Guild)
- BGI-Nexus's forthcoming working group sessions.
