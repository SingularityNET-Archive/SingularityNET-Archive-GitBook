# Week 45

## Thursday 6th November 2025

### Governance Workgroup

- **Type of meeting:** Weekly
- **Present:** Omolola Lawson [**facilitator**], Évéline Trinité [**documenter**], PeterE, CallyFromAuron, Sucre n Spice, Ayomi Shuga, AshleyDawn, LadyTempestt, Effiom, Maxmilez
- **Purpose:** Regular weekly Open Governance session
- **Working Docs:**

#### Narrative:
What is the best approach to select people for task? current 'first come, first served' approach isn't working. A fairer approach could be based on:

- skills /capability (how do we test for needed skills? what questions should we ask? will the approach privilege one skill set over others?   Skills audit?)

- past performance (does this mean a reputation system? How should we record people's past performance?)

- time taken to complete (Not always a priority - quick completion but to a poor standard is a problem),

- mentorship (expensive and time-consuming, but maybe needed to help people improve their skills).

- application and even interview (but who's the interviewer? Those with relevant skills? If yes, that rules them out from applying. And - how to verify people's experience/skills?)

- giving trial periods (do we take chances and allow people to learn on the job? or experiment by randomly assigning tasks to see how a person handles it? and if that is an option, for how long? It would be time consuming and might be expensive).

- nomination (WGs nominate people? or open nomination across the whole program? Is self-nomination OK? What info would nominees need to give? how would we know if info given is accurate?

- lottery approach (like jury service. Studies show it can work. But - lottery of everyone, or just of those who have relevant skills?)

We discussed the idea of implementing a more open approach as an experiment, by assigning a task to anyone who wants to do it, to see how well it works. We decided to trial it with the task of analysing the current sentiment survey - we'll invite anyone who wants to do it to offer an analysis alongside Tevo's.

 
We also said that for future task assignments, we could try a lottery approach, or could try nomination with fairly minimal information required.



#### Discussion Points:
- What is the best approach to select people for major tasks? 


#### Decision Items:
- As an experiment, we will offer the (unpaid) task of analysing the current sentiment survey to anyone who is interested, without the need for formally applying or demonstrating capability. This will be done in addition to Tevo's analysis.
