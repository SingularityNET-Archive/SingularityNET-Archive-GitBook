#### Narrative:
Intro: The meeting began with the discussion of ongoing tasks, Duke gave an update on Martinsoki work and issue on the email, he noted that he plans to follow up with ESE about that and share a spreadsheet with Martin. He also mentioned the work with Lola and how it is falling in place. 

Lean Guild Challenge: Uknowzork noted that they hadn’t been able to reach ESE regarding the Lean Guild Challenge because she had been offline.


Team Reorganization and Reward Adjustments: SucrenSpice announced a restructuring of team roles, including reassigning Kateri and Ese to focus on the Lean Guild Challenge, while moving Uknowzork into the Twitter Community/X space role previously handled by Kateri and the removal of Martinsoki from the Village Meeting. SucrenSpice also addressed changes to the rewards distribution, noting that the drop in token price reduced the total available funds from 1,800 USD to 1,050 USD. The rewards will now be issued in AGIX tokens to preserve their value.

Duke offered to help Martinsoki learn System.io by finding a suitable video tutorial. Martinsoki added that he is currently watching YouTube lessons to better understand how to use the platform.

Email Marketing Strategy: Duke and Martinsoki reviewed the current email marketing approach. Duke noted that the existing educational-style content might result in a low open rate and suggested shifting to a more direct, action-focused style aligned with direct response copywriting. He also proposed revisiting the setup of the email marketing platform to support this improved structure. Both agreed to schedule a follow-up call to further refine the email content and overall strategy.

Twitter Space Event Coordination: The team reviewed plans for the upcoming Twitter Space event scheduled for next Thursday, emphasizing the need to coordinate with Lola to finalize the event flyer. Duke faced technical issues and had to leave the meeting early, so the team agreed to continue the conversation asynchronously. Colly offered support for any questions or challenges that might come up. The discussion concluded with a reminder to reach out to Lola promptly to confirm all event details.

#### In this meeting we discussed:
- AI Sandbox/Think-tank Introduction
The meeting began with LordKizzy welcoming attendees.

Content Optimization Strategy Review: 
LordKizzy presented a comprehensive analysis of content performance across Medium and YouTube platforms, highlighting key findings and recommendations for SEO optimization. The team identified priority hashtags and high-value keywords for better SEO, such as "AI," "SingularityNet," and "AGI," and suggested implementing a minimum of 5-7 hashtags per article. For YouTube, they noted a significant performance gap between top AGI content and their own, recommending changes to video titles, the inclusion of expert names, and the use of high-performing keywords. LordKizzy shared a 30-day implementation plan to improve content optimization and suggested updating the Ambassador Program Town Hall titles to include specific keywords and expert names. The team also created a handbook to guide content posting improvements and shared insights with social media managers for further implementation.
- Social Media Data Analysis Challenges: 
Osmium discussed data collection and analysis challenges across various social media platforms, including YouTube and Medium. They explained that manual audits and custom tools were needed due to inconsistent data availability and poor UI, with specific issues noted around profile pictures and banners. The discussion concluded with a suggestion from Advanceameyaw to develop a centralized AI tool that could automatically pull and analyze analytics from multiple platforms, which Ambassadors acknowledged as a potential future improvement.
- Social Media Dashboard Proposal: 
Osmium proposed creating a new social media dashboard tool for the marketing team, building upon previous work done by Rojo that was not completed. The team discussed the need for dedicated developer support to successfully roll out the AI sandbox mode and considered the possibility of collaborating with Deepfunding.
- Exploring Partnership and Collaboration: 
The team discussed extending their current project to include deepfunding initiatives, and explored potential collaborations with developers. LordKizzy mentioned reaching out to Ubio Obu (Deepfunding Developeer Outreach Circle) through Osmium to initiate a partnership, despite challenges posed by token price fluctuations. Advanceameyaw suggested defining the specific type of collaboration or partnership they aim to establish, emphasizing the need for clarity on what services or tools would be involved. He also proposed creating a document outlining the partnership goals to facilitate discussions.
