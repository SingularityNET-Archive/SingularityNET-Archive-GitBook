#### Narrative:
Intro: The meeting began with the discussion of ongoing tasks, Duke gave an update on Martinsoki work and issue on the email, he noted that he plans to follow up with ESE about that and share a spreadsheet with Martin. He also mentioned the work with Lola and how it is falling in place. 

Lean Guild Challenge: Uknowzork noted that they hadn’t been able to reach ESE regarding the Lean Guild Challenge because she had been offline.


Team Reorganization and Reward Adjustments: SucrenSpice announced a restructuring of team roles, including reassigning Kateri and Ese to focus on the Lean Guild Challenge, while moving Uknowzork into the Twitter Community/X space role previously handled by Kateri and the removal of Martinsoki from the Village Meeting. SucrenSpice also addressed changes to the rewards distribution, noting that the drop in token price reduced the total available funds from 1,800 USD to 1,050 USD. The rewards will now be issued in AGIX tokens to preserve their value.

Duke offered to help Martinsoki learn System.io by finding a suitable video tutorial. Martinsoki added that he is currently watching YouTube lessons to better understand how to use the platform.

Email Marketing Strategy: Duke and Martinsoki reviewed the current email marketing approach. Duke noted that the existing educational-style content might result in a low open rate and suggested shifting to a more direct, action-focused style aligned with direct response copywriting. He also proposed revisiting the setup of the email marketing platform to support this improved structure. Both agreed to schedule a follow-up call to further refine the email content and overall strategy.

Twitter Space Event Coordination: The team reviewed plans for the upcoming Twitter Space event scheduled for next Thursday, emphasizing the need to coordinate with Lola to finalize the event flyer. Duke faced technical issues and had to leave the meeting early, so the team agreed to continue the conversation asynchronously. Colly offered support for any questions or challenges that might come up. The discussion concluded with a reminder to reach out to Lola promptly to confirm all event details.
