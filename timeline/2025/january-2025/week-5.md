#### Narrative:
Clement presented his and AdvanceAmeyaw's revised proposal to attend  the ETHiopia event using funding from Reserves. They have addressed the issues raised in the consent form by:
- reducing overall cost by c. $1k
- reducing budget for accommodation
- staying 2 days at their own expense
- securing a presentation slot
- planning to distribute merch and brochures
- aiming to establish an Ethiopia branch of African Guild (during the time they are there at their own expense
- setting definite KPIs
- making some short videos, to use as part of a recap video later
- writing a post-conference report
- writing an article, in collab with Writers WG and Marketing Guild
- committing to a post-event retrospective meeting in the Ambassador Program itself, where we can look at how it went, and use that information to help finalise our thinking on when and in what circumstances Reserves should be used for attending events (see https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yggRVo_-VzjDPvlgJtxeEp0G8oLx6i8sGYmU9mJiTT0/edit?usp=sharing)

The meeting noted that they have committed to a lot of work; and suggested they reduce some of their KPI targets (e.g. AI Ethics interviews from 20 to 10).

We also noted that where their proposal mentions "partnerships", they don't have the authority to initiate actual partnerships with sNET, so this will be reworded to make it clear that it is just about collating contacts, and passing them on where appropriate so that any potential partnerships can be explored.

We also noted that a useful KPI would be getting interested people to attend Ambassador TH and relevant WGs - Clement and Ameyaw will add this.

And we agreed that their attendance at the event is a test-case for how Reserves should be spent on events - so we will use their post-event report, plus insights from a retrospective meeting when they return, to inform our final decisions on this issue (see https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yggRVo_-VzjDPvlgJtxeEp0G8oLx6i8sGYmU9mJiTT0/edit?usp=sharing)

Overall, the meeting agree that all the objections are addressed, so the proposal is approved; and we discussed how best to release funds (via a fund request on Dework).


We then ran through the document of suggestions on how to set Q2 2025 budget caps (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kVd_4Ih-lSdMoIcmVeOS3_H3aqOdnMmMG6o1WqGTx1w/edit?usp=sharing), with some minor discussion for clarification. We agreed that everyone will look at this doc properly in the next few days, and it will be discussed at the next meeting on Tues 4th Feb.



#### Discussion Points:
- Decision on AdvanceAmeyaw and Clemennt's proposal to use Ambassador Reserves funding to attend ETHiopia event in mid Feb
- Q2 2025 budget caps

#### Decision Items:
- We agreed that Advance and Clement's proposal to attend the ETHiopia event has been agreed, and they will go
  - [**rationale**] because their revised proposal has addressed all of the issues raised in the consent forms
  - [**opposing**] none

### WG Sync Call

No Summary Given

### African Guild

- **Type of meeting:** Weekly
- **Present:** Duke [**facilitator**], CJFrankie [**documenter**], Clement, Advanceameyaw, Cjfrankie, SucrenSpice, Onize, Duke, esewilliams, Evelyn
- **Purpose:** The African Guild weekly meeting and progress updates.

#### Narrative:
Intro: The weekly meeting of the African guild kicked off with a welcoming greeting from Duke; Following a discussion from previous meetings, Duke made it clear that moving forward, the African guild will not be meeting weekly but rather on a biweekly schedule. 

Q4 marketing initiatives: From the marketing side of things, CjFrankie shared an update on the Q1 marketing initiative; he stated that the team is still brainstorming around what the best strategy would be for the guild in Q1. 

Education & translation initiative: This groundbreaking initiative is spearheaded by Sucre and Clement, whose vision is to create a communication-centered initiative focused on AI/ASI in the African context. We had a presentation from Clement, which included a clear explanation of the project. Still in its infancy, Clement added that Africa lags in communications around AI, and the goal of the project is to bridge the gaps using a multilingual educational approach to create and translate artificial intelligence materials in three African languages. More so, some of the major objectives of this project are to diversify AI, ASI, and the SingularityNET ecosystem at large. Develop a library of multilingual AI content that can be used for continuous learning and engagement and create a learning platform for mass adoption. 

The idea of creating a learning platform piqued Duke’s interest, which led to him asking further questions for clarity's sake: Clement clears the air by saying that the “learning platform” will be like a knowledge repository where people go for continuous knowledge sharing and learning, and the team may consider using a YouTube channel, while Duke suggested that Udemy will be a good platform to explore. This conversation switched gears as Duke talked about the importance of partnership in any project. At a glance, the initiative looks promising already, and there's a need to partner with some other WGs like the marketing guild, video, or writers WG to help us better amplify and publicize any future initiatives. 

Partnership: Duke hinted that phase two of Ubuntu and AI is already in progress; he added that phase one of Ubuntu and AI didn’t get the attention we needed, and as a result, the African guild should strengthen their ties with other workgroups to achieve great results. The meeting also included discussions about Clement and Advance Emmanuel, who recently received funding to travel to Ethiopia to spread awareness about SingularityNET and onboard new members through interviews and surveys. Congratulations to both Clement and Advance—cheers to a successful year ahead!

noted that education is organizing webinar series in relation to expert-led workshops and so we want to collaborate with them. 
Vasu noted that the Expert led is a deep drive into the project, which aim to leverage expertise into Singularitynet to educate and inspire the community.
He went further and said the workshop will feature presentations, case studies, modules delivered by experts which will help provide participants with in depth insights into AI applications, emerging trends and innovative solutions.
Purpose is to encourage collaboration and partnership.
- Open discussion: 
Ethical and regulatory issues and how researchers based AI could be going to prevent misuse? Peter stated that being centralized is being governed by single body and so could use AI for different application and sometimes it’s not properly governed which could cause harm. Ashley stated that establishing government work can help prevent the misuse of the centralized AI because the most complied to the existing regulations and such as data protection and privacy laws.

Security and trust, how can decentralized AI ensure secured data, transmission, and storage to prevent data breaches? Vasu stated that some of the companies have some biases upon trust and it has become a trust issue and not a security issue.

How can AI models improve without centralizing the data? Ashley stated that using secured aggregation techniques such as combining data from multiple source in which ensure confidentiality of the data. It will ensure secure data transmission and storage.

Will decentralized AI become the mainstream or will centralized AI always dominate? Peter said that is a believer in decentralized AI compared to centralized. But if people are using something they don’t care about centralized vs decentralized, they just care about using it.
