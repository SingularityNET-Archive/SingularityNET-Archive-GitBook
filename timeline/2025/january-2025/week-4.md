#### Narrative:
Criteria for core contributors:

In the last round, there was room for self-nomination and nomination by others, for people that didn't reach the criteria for getting the core contributor role.

The meeting  noted Tevo's comments in the GovWG Discord channel about the rewards threshold and participation threshold: "Some of the downsides come because the rewards are more centralised to current core contributors and seems high earners are earning even more funds compared to last quarter, leaving out less tasks for people to reach 1000 AGIX threshold. In addition the core contributor list by rewards also affected by the price changes. The higher the AGIX price goes, the harder is to reach the threshold. However, the majority of renominated members are due to not attending enough meetings or not being recognized. From next quarter if people interested we can double down on Process Guild service to import Zoom participation to Treasury Manager, for now I do not know if we have funds for that. we definitely have the capability (even if still semi-automated)".

and from Vani: "But interestingly, this means we have 60 core contributors this time - and (what I am pretty sure is) a record 20% having been manually nominated.
Hmmm... does this suggest we need to have a look at the criteria? Or are the criteria fine, and these are just anomalies?"

Currently we use:

1. Time-based recognition
What does "participation" mean? Is it just for passively attending meetings, or for actually taking part? speaking, commenting in Chat, etc)
Vani noted that for now it is based only on attendance - we can't easily capture who is contributing in a meeting, as it could be complex to capture who spoke or commented in Chat.

2. Fund request recognition
Clement noted that the criterion for having to be rewarded with at least 1000 AGIX in the last three months is not fair because of fluctuation in token price.

Peter noted that we don't require both time-based recognition and fund request recognition: it's either / or.
However, the meeting still felt that the threshold should be in USD, not AGIX, to minimise the effects of token price fluctuation.
After discussion, we agreed the threshold should be 300 USD a quarter.


Self nomination:

Should self-nomination continue to be possible, for people who have not reached the criteria for being a core contributor?
Vani raised the issue of potential hostile capture if people can self-nominate, and suggested there should be no self-nomination; nominations should have to be made by an existing Core Contributor.
Peter said he thinks it would usually be OK if a person is new and nominates themself.
A poll was drawn and 11 people out of 14 said there should be no self nomination, but we agreed that we will revisit the decision after the end of Q1 2025.


Proposal for Attendance at the ETHiopia conference  https://eth-iopia.xyz/
By Clement and Advanceameyaw 
They would like to be funded from Program reserves to represent sNET at this event.
We noted that 2 focus groups have met to discuss criteria for using Reserves for event attendance - their recommendations have not yet been discussed or ratified, but this proposal meets most of them except a suggested budget limit per person. However, we also noted that this suggested limit may be too low - flights within Africa are very expensive, so a low budget limit could have the unintended effect of preventing African’s from attending African events 
The proposal was explained and we concluded that the proposal should be posted in Discord for all core contributors to consent or object,  and the results should be discussed in the Open Governance meeting on Thurs 28th Jan.




#### Discussion Points:
- Criteria to be core contributor
- Self nomination 
- attendance at ETHiopia conference

#### Decision Items:
- We agreed to change the fund request recognition criterion for becoming a Core Contributor from 1000 AGIX to 300 USD
  - [**rationale**] Because, given that many WGs set task prices in USD, having the threshold in AGIX makes it unfairly difficult to become a core contributor when token price is low.
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We decided that for the coming Quarter (Q2 2025) self-nomination will no longer be possible 
  - [**opposing**] we agreed that we will revisit this decision after the end of Q1 2025
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople

#### Action Items:
- [**action**] Vani to make a consent form for the proposal to attend the ETHiopia event in February, and post it in the "Decision To Be Made" Discord channel  [**assignee**] CallyFromAuron [**due**] 28 January 2025 [**status**] todo

#### Narrative:
Introduction: The meeting began with a discussion led by Duke about the quorum required for the weekly meetings. He raised the question of what should be the minimum number of attendees needed to constitute a valid meeting, given that their average attendance is around 14-15 people, but they've had meetings with as few as 3-4 people. We debated whether decisions made by a smaller quorum should be considered binding, even if the majority of members were absent.

Ese suggested that the quorum could be set at a minimum of 6 members, with the understanding that the gravity of the agenda items should also be considered. Ayo felt that monthly meetings would not work if the goal is to build a true community, and that bi-weekly meetings are more appropriate. We agreed to keep the meeting time the same, despite some suggestions to change it.

The discussion then moved to marketing initiatives. Ese reported they are still in the ideation phase, and need to have final brainstorming sessions to select a campaign focused on engaging the wider African community. Duke suggested it would be helpful to plan marketing initiatives further in advance, aligning them with the overall Singularity Net narrative and topics like Artificial Superintelligence (ASI).

Kossiso provided an update on Colossal AI's efforts to democratize access to AI in Africa. They are planning a series of training programs in February to teach people how to integrate AI into their workflows, as well as how to deploy large language models locally. This will be followed by a policy discussion event in March, and the launch of their own AI model, Imara, built on the DeepSeek foundation.

Clement discussed an upcoming "Afro-AI Multilingual Literacy Drive" initiative, which will focus on creating community-centered educational materials to demystify AI and showcase its practical applications in areas like agriculture, education, health, and fintech. The content will feature African innovators and use storytelling approaches to inspire local participation.

#### Discussion Points:
- Introductory Message for Media Room: Kizzy kicked off the meeting by presenting the introductory message for the media room to the representatives of each guild and workgroup. The purpose was to guide them in reaching out to the social media admins for scheduling and coordination.

- Member Attendance Report: Kizzy presented the attendance review sheet, explaining the color-coded system. Members in green were approved to retain their roles, those in orange would be demoted to task force members, and those in red would no longer contribute to the group.

- Roles and Responsibilities: Kizzy outlined the roles and responsibilities for each member of the Marketing Guild, explaining how members can take on specific roles
- Event role creation: A new role, called the Event Role, was created. The primary purpose of this role is to have someone attend events, promote SingularityNET and its events, and evaluate the impact of the events using metrics such as attendance, engagement, and ROI. This role will also involve seeking potential collaboration opportunities.

- Attendance and Role Demotion: Kenichi expressed opposition to the idea of demotion based on his performance in the task role. He recommended that his attendance in Q3 be considered in comparison to Q4 when evaluating his role.

- Attendance Reminder: Kizzy emphasized the importance of providing prior notice in case of absence. He reminded the team that, as core team members, attending calls—especially for decision-making—is mandatory. He also noted that Task Force members are not as tightly bound to this requirement.

- Attendance Discrepancy: Malik pointed out that he was marked absent on October 4th, 2024, despite having evidence to show that he was present.

- Rules and Reassessment: Kizzy clarified that the current rules will apply only for this quarter. The team will reassess at the end of the quarter. Members who meet the criteria for promotion will be moved back to core team status, while those who don’t will be demoted to Task Force members. Members who fail to meet at least 50% of the criteria will not hold any role in the marketing team.

- Town Hall meeting update: Kizzy suggested that for Town Hall meeting update, we went through an assessment of the roles and responsibilities. We completed the Zealy sprints that we had previously.
- Twitter Upgrade: Mikasa mentioned that the team is upgrading from Twitter Premium to Twitter Plus. This decision followed a discussion in the Writers Workgroup last week. The Plus plan offers a range of benefits, with a cost of $22 per month or $229 per year.
- Zealot Initiative Feedback: Kenichi commented on the Zealot initiative and shared that the Writers' Workgroup plans to launch a Zealy initiative using their original methods, while Ese emphasized that creating a successful campaign takes time.


#### Decision Items:
- We agreed to create a poll for members to vote for or against the demotion of members who don’t meet the attendance benchmark.

#### Narrative:
Kick-off: The writers' workgroup weekly meeting kicked off at 3:10 p.m. Kenichi skimmed through the action items from the last meeting. 

Twitter Premium+: We started by discussing how three workgroups (writers, video, and marketing) can collaborate to subscribe to a Twitter premium plan. Kenichi added that it would be a great idea for us to pay for a yearly subscription. 

Community page on X: One of the WWG's missions for 2025 is to see our platforms grow while reaching a wider audience, such as crypto and web3 enthusiasts. In our last meeting, we decided to start pushing out Town Hall recaps: a weekly report that covers highlights from the ambassadors program. More so, the monthly workgroup updates are no different! We also seek to share these insights with the community using the community page on X. Kenichi also spoke about the need for having moderators on the community page to oversee the process and also reply to questions from anyone. Additionally, he urged Scribblers to join the page and also introduce themselves.

Momentarily, Mikasa added that some of the engagement on X is from people outside the ambassador program; she suggested integrating a bot that would create an announcement on the discord server for people to see when new announcements are made. This led to a discussion about whether to have a separate channel for these announcements. Kenichi embraced the idea and said he’d reach out to Peter to discuss things further.

Web3 publishing platforms: This conversation started in Q4 2024. In this meeting, CjFrankie showcased Mirror.XYZ. A Web3 publishing platform that allows publishers to turn their fans or readers into collectors, it also allows publishers to mint all their content, and it allows for collaboration through co-authorship and multi-sigs. In the same light, Gorga introduced Cardano Spot, he added that the WWG can take advantage of it since we’re building on a Cardano platform, he said that the platform enables users to create a community and also publish their work. Kenichi embraced the idea and he asked Gorga to make a presentation for the next meeting, on Friday. Additionally, Kenichi proposed that CjFrankie and Gorga should write an introductory draft for Mirror and Cardano Spot respectively. The draft should introduce the SNET ambassador program, reference the latest updates like the ecosystem digest, and the first introductory draft of the ambassador program published on Medium. 

Zealy collaboration: The meeting featured the likes of LordKizzy, who seeks collaboration between WWG, video WG, and the marketing guild. According to Kenichi, the next Zealy sprint would kick off by February, and as a result, the three workgroups would need to discuss what the reward structure would be like, how quests would be reviewed, and whatnot. 

Role document: The WWG role document describes the roles of scribblers and scribes in the workgroup; Kenichi hinted that the role document would become active from the next meeting. Come next week, we shall review the document to see the KPIs attached to the roles we hold.
