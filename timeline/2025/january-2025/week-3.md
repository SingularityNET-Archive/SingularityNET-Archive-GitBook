#### Narrative:
We started by going through tasks “in progress” on Github;
We went through Q3 & Q4 Interviews updates from the assignees. Esther, Ætherblade and CallyFromAuron are still doing a quick review on the completed interview recordings to check if everything needed is in place before proceeding to payments.
AGI-24 payments to ambassadors involved; this will be resolved very soon(hopefully this month) with the foundation. We spoke a little bit more about how to sort future payments like this and get a fitting solution(invoice? Crypto? One-off contracts, etc). This discussion will also be taken up at the WG sync call for sure.
Documenting BeGIN open office: There may not be recordings for some of these meetings so Onize can't document them.
Admin team(WG Internal management, Co-Chair, WG Async Support, Community engagement, co-chair mentee) issues have been assigned to the respective assignees on GitHub.
Conferences and Events(discussed here https://snet-ambassadors.gitbook.io/singularitynet-archive/timeline/2024/december-2024/week-50): What AI Ethics Event should we attend this year? Should we focus on the ones organized by SNET itself only or should we look outside too? Here is a sheet on a list of future events and conferences we could check out 2025 AI Conventions, conferences and events 
Colleen the community manager brought up community discussion on AI Autonomy as something she would like to do this quarter. It will be discussed more in the future. 
WG Sync calls: any topics from AI Ethics? There is a rolling agenda. There is also a handy Google form here https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf5c_9AyIgLGkmbG6zF-6ewhOfka6E8Obw7BFUOvcDM6fzdnw/viewform?usp=header  that collects feedback from people.
Onto tasks “in to-do” on Github
We got updates(and some sort of “no update”) from people doing interviews in Q3 & Q4.
Survey sharing: no updates on GitHub from most of the assignees. Moved a few of them who did it to “in progress” and ”done”. The point here is to show evidence that they have shared them and no point waiting until the interested participants fill them out.
Interview Transcription: We suggested that people who did interviews be the ones to initially transcribe the recordings since they are in the best position to understand the conversation. It also needs to be human-corrected. There will be a training session for it.
Knowledge management/data analysis planning: This has more to do with what happens after the interviews are collected, how we work with the material obtained and how we analyze them. 
Ideation and attracting donors: how are we going to attract donors of money, time, competing power and opinions? Colleen, TheFreysDefi, and Ese are the assignees.

Extra Connected AGI-24 payments topic
Payments in AGIX; is it a good idea? Is it too much of a risk? Price fluctuations in the crypto world make it not much of a good idea. Should we price tasks a little bit higher to protect people’s rewards? We could also set aside some sort of contingency budget for situations like that.



#### Decision Items:
- The remaining budget(if any) from BeGIN open office meeting documentation will go back to the WG purse.
  - [**effect**] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- We will bring up the discussion on non-ambassador program payments in conjunction with the foundation we’ve been having to the next WG Sync call.

  - [Q1 2025 budget decision retrospective: Miro](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVLtid06I=/)

#### Narrative:
This session was a retrospective of the consent process for  Q1 2025 workgroup budgets.

See the Miro board here https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVLtid06I=/

Everyone present agreed that the implementation of budget caps has been broadly a success, especially in that it saved time and made the process less onerous; and most said that caps should be used again for Q2. However, several people noted that some of the higher-budget workgroups were not entirely happy at the enforced lowering of their budgets; and that we still need to discuss and refine the process of setting caps and e.g deciding how a WG's cap can be changed.

We noted that this last topic is on the rolling Governance WG agenda for our next meeting on Thurs 16th Jan.






#### Discussion Points:
- Retrospective on the consent process for Q1 budgets

#### Keywords/tags:
- **topics covered:** core contributors, participation, consent decision making, consent process, budget caps

#### Narrative:
Introduction: The meeting started with a warm welcome from Duke, who asked if we should continue the greetings in multiple languages. Clement responded that it should be ceremonial, maybe once a month or every first meeting of the month someone can be assigned to lead it.

Action item from last meeting was looked into and followed up.

Q4 AMA report: Duke noted that we have the audio reports but still need a written format of the report, which Ayo replied that the written report is ready.

Q4 marketing initiation update: CJ Franklin updated that nomination of four individual has been made for there outstanding submissions and the announcement will be made on the discord channel which will lead to a vote to determine the first, second, third and fourth places. The vote will determine the winners 

AMA session: This was held on 29th of November, which has at least 50 participant. They all came together to talk about the African landscape and how we are relating with AI and it was led by two amazing speakers Kosiso Udodi the founder of Colossai AI and Daniel Effiom the COO of Reno search. During the session there was icebreaker activities, speakers talk, interactive quizzes, closing remark and Q&A sessions.
The main objective for the AMA was to have people express there concerns and questions regarding AI which was achieved. Questions were buzzing, interaction was great and feedback was awesome. We marketed this event on various social media platforms both individually and also in the SingularitNet ecosystem.
Weaknesses: We had connectivity issues and also we expected wider reach not just Nigerians but other African nations which we didn't have.
Key learning: From the session we learned about the roadblocks or the obstacles that Africans is having concerning adopting artificial intelligence solution as fast as the Western world or the European world are doing and it was noted to be just a thing of infrastructure and economical challenge which is largely associated with governmental policies and out of our control. But at the same time we spoke on the essence of having practical solution in healthcare, education and basic things that we are dealing with within Africa that's the Europeans and western world already has.
Participants recommended that they should be better pre event communication, better details on events, better marketing strategy to reach more people, technical support for managing collectivity issues.
We conclusion the event by speaking on our Future events.

Duke also added that for the future iteration of the AMA session, we should discuss more on SingularityNet focused conversations.


Partnership: During the holiday Hogantuso reached out to Chainbase led in African. Hogan stated that Chainbase is an AI project, and so he spoke with the led and they would love to be in a collaboration with SingularityNet. Duke also stated that this is a great opportunity and since we have no issue will cross ecosystem collaboration, we could leverage on to promote SingularityNet ecosystem and the ambassador program but there is some constraints we may have due to resources 

Q1  2025 budget fitting:  The focus group met over the week to fit our budget. It was noted that we requested 5,220 USD and the budget was broken down and fitted into Q1 activities which amounted to the allocated budget but because of our outstanding payment  from Q4, we are left with 3,450 USD and because of this we have had to cut down so many things including our weekly meetings, we would have to revert to bi weekly meetings to reduce cost.

Ubuntu and AI II: This phase two of the Ubuntu and AI project is mostly going to focus on consolidation and community building. We are looking at expanding our reach by hosting the Ubuntu and AI conversations in Egypt, South Africa, Rwanda and Ghana. 
Duke stated that the goal is to deepen our engagement within African communities, promote Ubuntu philosophy and AI ethics  and formalizing more partnerships and secure core funding.
This is a year long project, during of 12 months from January 2025 to December 2025. 

Duke discussed the SingularityNet Africa community's online platforms and a referral contest aimed at boosting engagement which top three will be rewarded. He highlighted the community's current membership is 257.
Duke also outlined marketing and education initiatives for this quarter which will including partnerships beyond the Singularity ecosystem. Which may lead to funding members attendance at AI and blockchain events across Africa.
