- Adoption of the fixed hourly AGIX rate for tasks and fixed AGIX amount
- Some fixed hourly rate tasks are meeting summary and review, preparation of meetings, and review of tasks
- Should we assign the report update to someone at the next meeting?

#### Decision Items:
- We will use the Exchange Rate (0.55) in Quarter 1. Hence, Hourly rate = Exchange Rate / 20 = 36 AGIX 
  - [**rationale**] This was the advised rate used when budgeting for Q1 2025

#### Narrative:
We started by going through tasks “in progress” on Github;
We went through Q3 & Q4 Interviews updates from the assignees. Esther, Ætherblade and CallyFromAuron are still doing a quick review on the completed interview recordings to check if everything needed is in place before proceeding to payments.
AGI-24 payments to ambassadors involved; this will be resolved very soon(hopefully this month) with the foundation. We spoke a little bit more about how to sort future payments like this and get a fitting solution(invoice? Crypto? One-off contracts, etc). This discussion will also be taken up at the WG sync call for sure.
Documenting BeGIN open office: There may not be recordings for some of these meetings so Onize can't document them.
Admin team(WG Internal management, Co-Chair, WG Async Support, Community engagement, co-chair mentee) issues have been assigned to the respective assignees on GitHub.
Conferences and Events(discussed here https://snet-ambassadors.gitbook.io/singularitynet-archive/timeline/2024/december-2024/week-50): What AI Ethics Event should we attend this year? Should we focus on the ones organized by SNET itself only or should we look outside too? Here is a sheet on a list of future events and conferences we could check out 2025 AI Conventions, conferences and events 
Colleen the community manager brought up community discussion on AI Autonomy as something she would like to do this quarter. It will be discussed more in the future. 
WG Sync calls: any topics from AI Ethics? There is a rolling agenda. There is also a handy Google form here https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf5c_9AyIgLGkmbG6zF-6ewhOfka6E8Obw7BFUOvcDM6fzdnw/viewform?usp=header  that collects feedback from people.
Onto tasks “in to-do” on Github
We got updates(and some sort of “no update”) from people doing interviews in Q3 & Q4.
Survey sharing: no updates on GitHub from most of the assignees. Moved a few of them who did it to “in progress” and ”done”. The point here is to show evidence that they have shared them and no point waiting until the interested participants fill them out.
Interview Transcription: We suggested that people who did interviews be the ones to initially transcribe the recordings since they are in the best position to understand the conversation. It also needs to be human-corrected. There will be a training session for it.
Knowledge management/data analysis planning: This has more to do with what happens after the interviews are collected, how we work with the material obtained and how we analyze them. 
Ideation and attracting donors: how are we going to attract donors of money, time, competing power and opinions? Colleen, TheFreysDefi, and Ese are the assignees.

Extra Connected AGI-24 payments topic
Payments in AGIX; is it a good idea? Is it too much of a risk? Price fluctuations in the crypto world make it not much of a good idea. Should we price tasks a little bit higher to protect people’s rewards? We could also set aside some sort of contingency budget for situations like that.



#### Decision Items:
- The remaining budget(if any) from BeGIN open office meeting documentation will go back to the WG purse.

- We will bring up the discussion on non-ambassador program payments in conjunction with the foundation we’ve been having to the next WG Sync call.

  - [Q1 2025 budget decision retrospective: Miro](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVLtid06I=/)

#### Narrative:
This session was a retrospective of the consent process for  Q1 2025 workgroup budgets.

See the Miro board here https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVLtid06I=/

Everyone present agreed that the implementation of budget caps has been broadly a success, especially in that it saved time and made the process less onerous; and most said that caps should be used again for Q2. However, several people noted that some of the higher-budget workgroups were not entirely happy at the enforced lowering of their budgets; and that we still need to discuss and refine the process of setting caps and e.g deciding how a WG's cap can be changed.

We noted that this last topic is on the rolling Governance WG agenda for our next meeting on Thurs 16th Jan.






#### Discussion Points:
- Retrospective on the consent process for Q1 budgets

#### Keywords/tags:
- **topics covered:** core contributors, participation, consent decision making, consent process, budget caps
- **emotions:** Thoughtful , focused, participatory
