#### Narrative:
This session was a retrospective of the consent process for  Q1 2025 workgroup budgets.

See the Miro board here https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVLtid06I=/

Everyone present agreed that the implementation of budget caps has been broadly a success, especially in that it saved time and made the process less onerous; and most said that caps should be used again for Q2. However, several people noted that some of the higher-budget workgroups were not entirely happy at the enforced lowering of their budgets; and that we still need to discuss and refine the process of setting caps and e.g deciding how a WG's cap can be changed.

We noted that this last topic is on the rolling Governance WG agenda for our next meeting on Thurs 16th Jan.
