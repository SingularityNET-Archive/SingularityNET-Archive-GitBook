  - [Q1 2025 budget decision retrospective: Miro](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVLtid06I=/)

#### Narrative:
This session was a retrospective of the consent process for  Q1 2025 workgroup budgets.

See the Miro board here https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVLtid06I=/

Everyone present agreed that the implementation of budget caps has been broadly a success, especially in that it saved time and made the process less onerous; and most said that caps should be used again for Q2. However, several people noted that some of the higher-budget workgroups were not entirely happy at the enforced lowering of their budgets; and that we still need to discuss and refine the process of setting caps and e.g deciding how a WG's cap can be changed.

We noted that this last topic is on the rolling Governance WG agenda for our next meeting on Thurs 16th Jan.






#### Discussion Points:
- Retrospective on the consent process for Q1 budgets

#### Keywords/tags:
- **topics covered:** core contributors, participation, consent decision making, consent process, budget caps
- **emotions:** Thoughtful , focused, participatory
