## Saturday 4th January 2025

### Gamers Guild

- **Type of meeting:** Biweekly
- **Present:** Slate [**facilitator**], devon [**documenter**], malik, rebel, AshleyDawn, lord kizzy, Kateri, Gorga Siagian, TheFreysDeFi, Slate
- **Purpose:** To introduce new features (a voice-changing zone system and dynamic, wind-responsive trees) for use in the Gamers Guild’s main VR map on Roblox and to review recent feedback from the Treasury Guild regarding additional dashboards and scheduling features.
- **Working Docs:**

#### Discussion Points:
- Voice-Changing Zones Presented by Slate: Slate demonstrated three color-coded zones (white, red, green), each modifying players’ voices differently (e.g., amplified, echo, robotic).
- Slate encouraged current map creators to incorporate these zones into fun builds, speech competitions, or intercom systems in the main VR experience.
- Slate showcased realistic, wind-influenced trees that enhance immersion and visual appeal.
- slate recommended dynamic trees for creators working on forested or outdoor areas of the main Ambassador Program on Roblox. Trees can be customized to sway faster or slower.
- Treasury Guild feedback relayed by Kizzy: 

Add a second dashboard for Budget Planner or resource tracking in the Treasury Guild’s meeting room.
Add both Treasury Guild session times and Treasury Operations call times to the dashboard displaying the meeting date and time.
Information in the dialogue system is outdated and needs to be updated.
- Kizzy noted that more adjustments might be needed, pending final feedback from Tevo and other Treasury members.

- Slate emphasized that assets should not simply be templates from various sites; they must reflect the SingularityNet theme, or they will be rejected.

- Treasury guild model will be updated
  - [**rationale**] feedback from treasury guild members
