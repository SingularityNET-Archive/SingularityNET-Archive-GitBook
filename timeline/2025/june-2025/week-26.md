#### Narrative:
Guillermo began his presentation by clarifying the importance of a soft launch for the governance system dashboard emphasizing the need for initial debugging and testing before fully integrating it into the live consent process. He explained that the system was already live and began walking through it with a screen share. He demonstrated the login process, which currently uses Discord as the authentication method, though integrations with Google and others may follow. The login leads to a platform where users have distinct roles like Super Admins, Admins, Core Contributors, and Community Members. Each role has defined access levels. For example, community members can read and submit proposals but cannot vote in the consent process.

Guillermo noted that what was being shown was a draft and not a final. He demonstrated how core contributors can navigate the system: logging in, accessing the dashboard, and interacting with different sections like Education, Documentation, and Proposals. The proposal section is functional, with the ability to comment and vote, offering upvotes, abstentions, and downvotes. Comments can be categorized as suggestions, concerns, or arguments, using a checkbox system. However, he mentioned issues raised during R&D discussions, like mismatches between selected checkboxes and the rationale provided. 

The platform structure allows for quarterly instances like Q4 Reports. Each workgroup will submit a proposal representing their report, budget, and key contributions. These proposals will be archived and displayed under specific instances in the dashboard. Guillermo showed an example test proposal from the R&D group, which included integrated links and structured content. Although some data had been reset due to development iterations, he reiterated that the platform is ready to demonstrate proposal creation and voting flow later in Town Hall.

He then introduced the collaboration and skill database, describing it as an interactive platform where users can create profiles with bios, selected workgroups, skills, and other metadata like language and location. This directory will allow searching by name or workgroup and enable profile editing, image uploading, CV attachment, and future messaging features. He highlighted that availability status, wallet address options, and tagging workgroup affiliations were in place. Vani raised a wallet address privacy concern. She stated that it shouldn't be a piece of public information. Guillermo addressed the concerns stating that while the system architecture supports wallet integration, it will be phased in later and it will respect user privacy preferences. Only core contributors will have access to certain governance functionalities, and visibility settings will be configurable.

Guillermo emphasized the importance of keeping the platform practical and building only what is useful. He noted that the second round of consent he participated in helped shape the platform’s design and features. When a workgroup lead creates a proposal, they will be able to edit it, track changes, and register revisions with timestamps. More than one representative per workgroup will be permitted to input proposals to avoid bottlenecks.

Moving to visuals, Guillermo showed a Figma design mockup of the platform. The left navigation highlights active instances like Q4 reports. Each proposal page is represented with icons, comment counts, and contributors. He noted that Educational content, status indicators, and embedded infographics will support the consent process. He explained how voting will be done via a pop-up selection (e.g., object, consent, abstain) with rationale input captured in the database rather than Google Forms.

He also shared an organizational chart labeling workgroups based on their focus—Education, Communication, and Strategy explaining that while he doesn’t favor rigid segmentation, this visual helps identify overlap and strategic alignment. He asked for feedback on what was missing, what should be removed, and what could be improved.

Guillermo emphasized that while the platform’s architecture is solid, its value depends on collaborative input and refinement. He reminded the group that contributions like tasks, suggestions, or ideas should be valued and that a consistent taxonomy and task-labeling system could improve both visibility and budgeting clarity. For instance, showing the proportion of funds spent on different categories (admin, outreach, and the like) would help strategic planning.

He closed with reflections on integrating other tools like GitHub or DeWork, noting that the inconsistency in how teams document tasks make standardized integration difficult. Nonetheless, the system being built could evolve into a broader contribution-tracking model, not just for governance but for the entire community’s work. He concluded with light humor about pulling this all together with minimal resources but with optimism for improving it in the next test phase.

With a few minutes remaining in the session, Peter brought up the need to create a facilitation schedule for the upcoming months, noting that planning currently ends after this week. He proposed a simple rotation system, given there are two governance meetings per week, and he invited attendees to indicate their interest in facilitating either by raising hands or using the chat.

Vani helped prompt volunteers, mentioning names like Alfred, Maxmilez, and UknowZork, who were already in the facilitation rotation. She offered to compile the list and update the facilitation sheet. She also asked Advance if he was up for it which he stated that he would not be able to due to his busy and tight schedule while Éveline tentatively expressed interest in the future.

Peter noted that we already have five names, enough to cover the first five sessions of the next quarter. As the meeting wrapped up Peter asked if there were any final topics to address. Vani informed the group that she wouldn’t be able to attend the upcoming Town Hall and that others might need to cover her usual workgroup reports.

The session closed with thanks to Guillermo for his dashboard demo. Guillermo apologized for any messiness but expressed optimism about the system’s progress. The meeting came to an end with Peter reminding the workgroup to attend the Town Hall that was scheduled for later today.
