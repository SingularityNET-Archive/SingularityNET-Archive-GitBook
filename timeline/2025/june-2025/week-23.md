#### Decision Items:
- Due to current token price being above $0.30, we agreed we can submit fund requests for all Q2 tasks now.

But we won't submit any pending tasks for Q1 at the moment
  - [**rationale**] The Q2 budget was calculated at the agreed exchange rate of $0.30, but Q1 was calculated at $0.55 so we're not there yet
  - [**opposing**] We might rethink in a month or two, and pay outstanding Q1 tasks anyway

- André's tool development in May (see https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/262) included 
- working on a caching issue with the Archives dashboard (still not completely fixed), - updating scripts to capture meeting summary audits, so we can see what kinds of corrections are made when we do audit summaries.

We discussed how it would be useful to categorise what different *types* of corrections are made to meeting summaries - Vani will add a list to the June tool development issue.

- In June, Stephen's focus will be on beginning to develop rule-based auditing of knowledge graph outputs - see https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/266 and https://github.com/Quality-Assurance-DAO/neo4j

This work will also be what Archives WG intends to focus on in Q3 2025; it might draw on sme ideas from the proposal that the Archives team submitted to the BGI Nexus funding round in March: https://deepfunding.ai/proposal/ethical-ai-auditing-a-practice-based-approach/
  - [**rationale**] To look at how communities can audit the knowledge graphs of their own data - an ethical approach
  - [**effect**] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- We closed the tag taxoonomy issue https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/133, and André will be using the defined tags in Q4 2025 when we re-start work on the redesigned Summary Tool. 

We might also use some of the insights from it in ur knowledge graph wrk in Q3.

- On the monthly archives GitBook issues: we noted that so far, Q2 summaries are being submitted without any chasing.

There are fewer meetings happening in general, since most WGs have moved to meeting only once a month; but the meetings that *are* happening, are generally getting summarised.

However, we noted that some cancelled meetings are still on the Calendar - we will ask WGs to tidy that up, since we take our list of what meetings are supposed to take place from the Calendar.

#### Action Items:
