  - [WG Budet Minimums](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/17a0CssxFOtK_Pd4Q-wMtBfMGJfVVtJlwjCTbbFmUBCE/htmlview?pli=1)

#### Narrative:
The workgroup discussion centered on the analysis document created by Tevo and Effiom from the survey, with the intention to clarify if it would affect the budget caps. 

Peter mentioned Slate’s comment on the Discord channel, noting that the survey still remains non-binding as no decisions have been made so far. He further said that during the workgroup sync call, we suggested doing another round of the survey with higher participation.
Vani noted that if we use the budgets suggested by Tevo as a result of the sentiment analysis, some WGs would get significantly less budget than they would with our existing caps. She has marked these WGs in blue on Sheet 1 of the Budget Minimums spreadsheet.

Guillermo provided feedback on the analysis, he emphasized that it will be critical to have a second round so we could compare. He also noted that some workgroups and guilds are not committed to deliverables and updates during monthly Town Hall Updates , he highlighted that the analysis does not reflect this and he will appreciate seeing analysis on deliverables and output. 
Peter suggested that we could do the other survey before the budget consent round, to ensure things are done well before moving forward. Tevo suggested that we could add sentiment to the consent process, as it will help target specific proposals of the workgroup/guild. Vani opt about the idea of attaching sentiment to the content process, as it will be enough for everyone to be advocating for their own group and could  prompt dishonesty for separate workgroup/guild members.

Sentiment vs Output Reality: 
Tevo highlighted that low sentiment scores might result from low engagement, not poor performance. Some workgroups had minimal participant feedback, making results unreliable.
Peter proposed having continuous sentiment collection to reflect changes over time, not just quarterly impressions.

Guillermo emphasized the need for output-driven strategy, not just activity. Unifying criteria across content creator groups (marketing, video, writers) would reduce redundancy and improve strategic effectiveness.He suggested that the sentiment analysis should be used to reallocate budgets towards groups with strong commitment and effective delivery, not simply sustain the status quo.

Peter suggested that groups with known reserves could reduce Q3 requests or not request at all. However, this raises fairness concerns as it might penalize honesty and reward silence. 
To be continued...


#### Discussion Points:
- A second round of sentiment collection may be needed, ideally with improved outreach, clarity, and explanation of purpose.

#### Keywords/tags:
- **topics covered:** priority, Workgroups, budget caps, consent process, Workgroup  reserves, budget allocation, sentiment analysis, Q3 2025 budget
- **emotions:** detailed, educative, caution, need for clarity

- **Working Docs:**
  - [Archive names (a list of the name that people are most commonly known by in the Archives)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r5LDA7yiERtWuu-HHYsBiG-RLyjDCtTZUB8H-xZHFsE/edit?usp=sharing)

#### Decision Items:
- Due to current token price being above $0.30, we agreed we can submit fund requests for all Q2 tasks now.

But we won't submit any pending tasks for Q1 at the moment
  - [**rationale**] The Q2 budget was calculated at the agreed exchange rate of $0.30, but Q1 was calculated at $0.55 so we're not there yet
  - [**opposing**] We might rethink in a month or two, and pay outstanding Q1 tasks anyway
  - [**effect**] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- André's tool development in May (see https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/262) included 
- working on a caching issue with the Archives dashboard (still not completely fixed), - updating scripts to capture meeting summary audits, so we can see what kinds of corrections are made when we do audit summaries.

We discussed how it would be useful to categorise what different *types* of corrections are made to meeting summaries - Vani will add a list to the June tool development issue.
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- In June, Stephen's focus will be on beginning to develop rule-based auditing of knowledge graph outputs - see https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/266 and https://github.com/Quality-Assurance-DAO/neo4j

This work will also be what Archives WG intends to focus on in Q3 2025; it might draw on sme ideas from the proposal that the Archives team submitted to the BGI Nexus funding round in March: https://deepfunding.ai/proposal/ethical-ai-auditing-a-practice-based-approach/
  - [**rationale**] To look at how communities can audit the knowledge graphs of their own data - an ethical approach
  - [**effect**] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- We closed the tag taxoonomy issue https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/133, and André will be using the defined tags in Q4 2025 when we re-start work on the redesigned Summary Tool. 

We might also use some of the insights from it in ur knowledge graph wrk in Q3.
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- On the monthly archives GitBook issues: we noted that so far, Q2 summaries are being submitted without any chasing.

There are fewer meetings happening in general, since most WGs have moved to meeting only once a month; but the meetings that *are* happening, are generally getting summarised.

However, we noted that some cancelled meetings are still on the Calendar - we will ask WGs to tidy that up, since we take our list of what meetings are supposed to take place from the Calendar.

#### Action Items:
- [**action**] Vani has approached DeepFunding to ask if the Events Circle could take on documentation of DF Town Hall. Events Circle is interested and is asking one of their members if he would be interested in taking it on. We'll review this next meeting.
 [**assignee**] CallyFromAuron [**due**] 2 July 2025 [**status**] in progress
- [**action**] Vani to make a list of the different types of coorrectioons that get made to meeting summaries, and add it to https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/263 [**status**] todo

- **Present:** PeterE [**facilitator**], Tevo [**documenter**], UKnowZork, Kateri, CallyFromAuron, guillermolucero, Tevo, Alfred Itodele, Sucre n Spice, Clement Umoh, Duke, Jeffrey Ndarake, martinsoki, maxmiles, PeterE
- **Purpose:** Regular weekly Open Governance meeting

- **Working Docs:**
  - [Ambassador Program Sentiment Distribution](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vFdaQelvCOcePcuuYp8mItIMvoenLzujr_2hRLfQnZc/edit?usp=sharing)
  - [WG Budget Minimums](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/17a0CssxFOtK_Pd4Q-wMtBfMGJfVVtJlwjCTbbFmUBCE/htmlview?pli=1)

#### Narrative:
Q3 Budget Cap Finalisation


#### Discussion Points:
- How do we proceed with Ambassador Program Budget Limits to existing groups?
- Even if some groups wouldn't request funding, it still would affect the broader structure
- [Sentiment analysis](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vFdaQelvCOcePcuuYp8mItIMvoenLzujr_2hRLfQnZc/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.o3fg3xit11r5) provided interesting outputs and an opportunity to change how we govern the budget, but further discussions and more involvement were expected before we implement it to steer our budgetary decisions.
- Several workgroups have not communicated their Q3 funding needs clearly, delaying the collective understanding of total financial obligations.
- There's a reliance on a few active contributors to raise concerns, with others remaining passive

#### Decision Items:
- Proceed with the percentage decrease based on the budget request in the previous quarter for the [Q3 budget limits](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17a0CssxFOtK_Pd4Q-wMtBfMGJfVVtJlwjCTbbFmUBCE/edit?gid=350992806#gid=350992806). 
  - [**rationale**] There was pushback to this change, but we could not find agreement on any other alternatives that could be applied in a relatively short amount of time (before the budget submission period)
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople

#### Action Items:
- [**action**] Update Core contributors about the new context and budget limits [**assignee**] CallyFromAuron [**due**] 9 June 2025 [**status**] todo

#### Keywords/tags:
- **topics covered:** Budget caps, Workgroup Funding, Sentiment Analysis
