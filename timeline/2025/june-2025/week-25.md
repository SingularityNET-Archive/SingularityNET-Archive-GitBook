#### Narrative:
The meeting began with Peter presenting the Consent Process results, followed by a brief exploration of the findings. All Workgroups passed the quorum threshold, which was set at 17%. The Workgroup with the lowest interaction was the Knowledge Base, with 10 contributors per consent, but it still met the quorum requirement.

We all noted the progress made in this quarter's Consent Process—33 people participated, marking a clear increase from the previous quarter.

We then reviewed the Workgroups that received objections to determine whether those objections were valid. Several key themes that emerged were whether Workgroups are evidencing their impact/outcomes - whether groups have unallocated reserves that they should be spending; and whether WGs have a clear "roadmap" of what they intend to do.

Vani noted that it is up to the Workgroups to decide whether they want to respond to the objections. She also emphasized the need to track recurring issues and include them in our reports. She proposed adding a new agenda item: “How do we handle objections that cannot be resolved within the timeframe of the Consent Process?” Peter supported the idea, saying it would be valuable to have that discussion. 
Slate raised a question about how Workgroups should respond to objections. Both Peter and Vani responded, stating that a clear document outlining the objections should suffice. 

For Consent Round 2 (same as last quarter) we concluded that no new objections may be raised. However, contributors can object to a Workgroup they've previously consented to if they now agree with existing objections, They can also consent to a Workgroup that they've previously objected to if they feel that the Workgroup have adequately addressed the issues.

Kateri also shared in the chat that she believes Workgroups should make it a priority to attend the monthly sync meetings. This would help members stay informed about ongoing progress and gain insights into each guild’s work.

We discussed anonymity in the Consent Process and learned that only 23.7% of contributors were uncomfortable with the lack of anonymization. Vani asked whether we are still planning to conduct sentiment analysis for the ongoing Consent Process. Peter responded that while it would be beneficial, he’s unsure if it can be integrated during the current process.

Wrapping up Peter also suggested that, moving forward, we should schedule the first Consent Process results meeting for two hours instead of one.
