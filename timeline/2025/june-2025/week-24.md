#### Narrative:
This week’s session focused mainly on reviewing our current budget, identifying areas of overspend, and discussing how to move forward more realistically given the current token price and how things are evolving across workgroups.

Peter kicked things off by suggesting we dive into the budget sheet. A few minor overages came up—which initially looked like rounding errors. However, upon closer inspection, the overspend in some areas was more significant and required further attention. Some adjustments had already been made, but some still stood out as needing resolution.

Tevo explained that the increase in the Treasury Guild budget was largely due to the fact that he used the previous quarter budget and he hasn’t done any recent budget for it. This change caused a noticeable jump in the numbers. He also reorganized the budget to clearly differentiate between ongoing activities and new initiatives that the extra budget would support. Regarding the Treasury Guild, Tevo admitted there hadn’t been enough time to conduct the regular discussions that typically justify its expenses. As a result, that budget line appeared somewhat unclear.

Vani raised a critical question—are we now over our overall budget cap, and is this level of spending sustainable? She also asked whether the current Treasury Guild budget was based on weekly sessions, even though the team had informally shifted to a biweekly schedule. Tevo confirmed that the budget assumed weekly activity but noted that they had already begun scaling back due to tight funding. He mentioned there was no leftover budget to pull from, so instead of padding the numbers, they chose to reduce the budget request directly. With the token price being so low, he explained, it's become increasingly difficult to justify maintaining certain activities unless the structure evolves accordingly.

The idea of removing the Treasury Guild line was raised, as it hadn’t been active recently. Tevo wondered if the difference between weekly and bi-weekly payments does impact the budget request. He asked if we want to have less bi-weekly treasury sessions, one month like a vacation for treasury operators, or he goes to the Swarm call to raise this up.

Guillermo joined with some reflections. He noted that while the system is currently under stress, that’s not necessarily a bad thing—it presents a good opportunity to test how resilient our governance structure really is. He emphasized the importance of clearly documenting all decisions so people understand what's happening. He also suggested that not everything requires weekly meetings—monthly sessions might suffice, provided we have solid supporting materials to ensure smooth operations.

Peter asked whether a deadline should be set for core contributor nominations. Tevo didn’t think a deadline was necessary but agreed it might help prompt action from those still uncertain about their roles. Demonix and UknowZork were added to the list of core contributors, though the list remains open for further nominations. Vani asked if there was anyone not yet included who should be, and suggested adding their names to the list for nominations.

During Consent form testing, Peter asked whether selecting a workgroup and seeing the “thanks” message meant the response was already recorded. Vani clarified that it didn’t—nothing is submitted until the “Submit” button is clicked, after which users have the option to submit another response. Peter noted that users are prompted again for their email and anonymity preferences, which Vani confirmed was intentional, as collecting that data is important.

Guillermo asked for the form link, saying he couldn’t find it but wanted to try it out and provide feedback. Vani shared the link in response.

We also discussed using the sentiment survey in the consent process. The goal is to ensure that feedback has a meaningful impact in Q4. Peter added that the previous round of feedback didn’t go well—participation was low, and the questions lacked clarity, making the results unhelpful.

Vani also suggested using the next Town Hall to walk everyone through the governance process in a more accessible way—explaining the “why” and “how” behind the Consent process. Everyone agreed that this was a strong idea.

With no more pressing questions, the meeting was concluded. The hope is that once this consent round and the budget restructuring are finalized, we can shift away from heavy administrative work and return to more creative, inspiring initiatives—such as inviting builders from the ecosystem to showcase what they’re working on. For now, though, the focus remains on tightening operations and improving transparency.
