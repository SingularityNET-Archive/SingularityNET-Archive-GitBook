#### Agenda item 2 - REVIEW KNOWLEDGE BASE GITBOOK - [carry over]

#### Discussion Points:
- What is the Knowledge Base GitBook useful for?
- The Knowledge Base GitBook serves as a structured repository for storing key assets and information, enabling better coordination in a decentralized environment. It helps establish a commonly understood source of truth, ensuring alignment and accessibility across contributors.
- The Knowledge Base GitBook is for searching general information about the Ambassador Program and understanding how contributors are engaging with current projects.
- While the initial Miro Board layout helped visualise content types and identify gaps, the transition to GitBook has made it difficult to compare the coverage of questions.
- Is there something that should be there that isn't there?

- Is there a link that should be removed?
- Is anything unclear or confusing?
- Can you think of “why” or “how” questions that you would like to know about the Ambassador Program in the KB structure?
- Do you use "Knowledge Bases" often?
- 
Decentralised organisations seem to use Knowledge Bases more often

### Governance Workgroup

- **Type of meeting:** Weekly
- **Present:** PeterE [**facilitator**], CallyFromAuron [**documenter**], PeterE, CallyFromAuron, Sucre n Spice, LadyTempestt, AshleyDawn, Tevo, Effiom, Évéline Trinité
- **Purpose:** Regular weekly GovWG meeting 
- **Working Docs:**
  - [Low Budget Brainstorm miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVISH_ACg=/)

#### Narrative:
We returned to the Low-Budget Brainstorm Miro board.
In advance of the meeting, Vani had organised the board by grouping ideas that were very similar, and numbering the ideas. 
We did a prioritising activity on the ideas - each person selected up to 5 favourite ideas, in order from best to worst, and copy-pasted them into the Miro under their name; then selected one or more ideas they felt were questionable or that they would prefer NOT to do. You can see the results at the bottom of the Miro board. 

(Note on Miro usage: not everyone did the activity - some people find it hard to access Miro, either due to poor Internet connectivity, or because Miro can be fiddly to use on a phone. Some people did post the numbers of their selected ideas in Chat, and someone else did it for them on the Miro booard.)

We then discussed the responses. For key points, see "decisions" below

There was some discussion on the idea of focusing on quality, not quantity, and minimising the activity of WGs which are not achieving "quality". On the questioon of how we define "quality" - there may be a need for greater clarity on WGs' purpose/aims. Each WG could be asked to define what they're *trying* to achieve, so that we can then assess whether they're achieving it. We noted that "work quality" is on the agenda for a future governance meeting.



#### Discussion Points:
- Prioritising suggestions on the Low-Budget Brainstorm Miro board

#### Decision Items:
- The ideas around paying in a stablecoin or converting to another currency (whether in the Ambassador wallet itself, or at WG level) might be interesting, but are currently not legally possible.
  - [**rationale**] Ambassador Program is not a legal entity. 
Who gets any profits accrued from conversion?
AGIX is a utility token.
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- Managing WHEN we pay (e.g. paying some tasks in advance, if token price is high at the start of a Quarter; or waiting to pay if token price is low) emerged as more feasible solutions to managing a budget
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- Some people liked the idea of minimising meeting frequency to save mooney
  - [**rationale**] We have tended in the past to have very frequent meetings; and meetings can accrue a lot of overhead
  - [**opposing**] Others felt it might lower engagement in the Ambassador Program overall, as meetings are the core way that people can get involved
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- On the idea of merging related WGs - it could be interesting and impactful, but on balance the idea was not popular
  - [**opposing**] the impact may be negative as it can disengage individuals who do something in a WG. It also could compromise workgroup autonomy.
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- Some people supported the idea of lowering rewards across the board and moving towards more volunteerism, but overall the idea was not popular
  - [**rationale**]  It is a way of working if we can't afford to pay people for the things we want to do
  - [**opposing**] Several people were very much against it on principle, on the grounds that we shouldn't expect people to work for free; so it should only be an absolute last resort, if at all
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- The idea of automating tasks such as translations raised objections
  - [**opposing**] because AI translation tools are not good enough yet, and a "human-in-the-loop" native speaker is still needed, so it might not save money in the end
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- Taking money from reserves to cover budget shortfalls was seen as unwise
  - [**rationale**] Spending reserves on maintaining our activities is not sustainable
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- The two "moneymaking" ideas - looking for other sources of funding, and supporting WGs to sell their tooling and skills as a service - were quite popular.
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople

#### Action Items:
- [**action**] We will leave the Miro open for a few days for contributions from others not present in this meeting, and to return to it after Easter (Open Goov meeting on 24th April) to look at how we progress the most popular ideas. [**assignee**] all [**due**] 24 April 2025 [**status**] todo

#### Keywords/tags:
- **topics covered:** stablecoins, Miro Board, work quality, WG purpose, token price, payment in advance, delaying payments, meeting frequency, workgroup autonomy, merging WGs, selling tools as a service, outside sources of funding, translation, AI translation
- **emotions:** engaging, Contributive, Interesting, Optimistic , Good natured

#### Discussion Points:
- Ayo kicked off the Marketing Guild call, welcoming attendees. Noticing the low turnout, he considered holding off a bit to see if more members would join. 
- Quorum Discussion and Updates: The discussion centered on the importance of establishing a quorum for future meetings, noting that sessions with low attendance risk being unproductive. Martinsoki suggested setting a minimum attendance threshold to determine whether meetings should proceed—a proposal that was well-received by others. Acknowledging that they currently lacked quorum, the group debated whether to continue or postpone the meeting. Members were encouraged to share updates that didn’t require consensus, underscoring the need for clearer attendance and decision-making protocols going forward.
- Updates on Proposals and Budget Discussion:
Lordkizzy shared updates from his conversations with Kenichi regarding the Zealy project, with EricDavies noting the lack of feedback on the proposal. He emphasized the importance of clearly defining the graphics team's responsibilities, with some input from CJFrankie expected next week. Lordkizzy also stressed the need to adjust Q2 rewards in light of the current token price.
- Updates on Twitter Spaces Document: Kenichi discussed a document he is developing to support the creation of Twitter databases, which he believes will aid growth efforts, despite facing technical difficulties. He proposed leveraging Twitter spaces to enhance the visibility of the Singularity Ambassador program and engage a wider audience.
- Updates on Governance document: Ese Williams raised concerns about unpaid payments for Eric Davies and Photogee, suggesting a separate call to address the issue. Ayo noted the difficulty of making decisions without a quorum, emphasizing the need to adopt formal governance documents. The discussion also highlighted the importance of improving communication and collaboration within the Marketing Guild.
Discussion on Core Member Rewards and Deliverables: Ayo emphasized the need to define core member value before addressing reward adjustments. Kareem noted that reduced funding for the graphics team would require scaled-back deliverables across all teams. 
Discussion on Attendance, Rewards, and Quorum: The discussion focused on the importance of establishing a quorum for meetings, especially as attendance has declined due to reduced rewards. Concerns were raised about how the current token price limits fair reward distribution. Suggestions included adjusting the number of members and how rewards are allocated to address past complaints.
