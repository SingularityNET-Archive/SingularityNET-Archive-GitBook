#### Discussion Points:
- Ayo kicked off the Marketing Guild call, welcoming attendees. Noticing the low turnout, he considered holding off a bit to see if more members would join. 
- Quorum Discussion and Updates: The discussion centered on the importance of establishing a quorum for future meetings, noting that sessions with low attendance risk being unproductive. Martinsoki suggested setting a minimum attendance threshold to determine whether meetings should proceed—a proposal that was well-received by others. Acknowledging that they currently lacked quorum, the group debated whether to continue or postpone the meeting. Members were encouraged to share updates that didn’t require consensus, underscoring the need for clearer attendance and decision-making protocols going forward.
- Updates on Proposals and Budget Discussion:
Lordkizzy shared updates from his conversations with Kenichi regarding the Zealy project, with EricDavies noting the lack of feedback on the proposal. He emphasized the importance of clearly defining the graphics team's responsibilities, with some input from CJFrankie expected next week. Lordkizzy also stressed the need to adjust Q2 rewards in light of the current token price.
- Updates on Twitter Spaces Document: Kenichi discussed a document he is developing to support the creation of Twitter databases, which he believes will aid growth efforts, despite facing technical difficulties. He proposed leveraging Twitter spaces to enhance the visibility of the Singularity Ambassador program and engage a wider audience.
- Updates on Governance document: Ese Williams raised concerns about unpaid payments for Eric Davies and Photogee, suggesting a separate call to address the issue. Ayo noted the difficulty of making decisions without a quorum, emphasizing the need to adopt formal governance documents. The discussion also highlighted the importance of improving communication and collaboration within the Marketing Guild.
Discussion on Core Member Rewards and Deliverables: Ayo emphasized the need to define core member value before addressing reward adjustments. Kareem noted that reduced funding for the graphics team would require scaled-back deliverables across all teams. 
Discussion on Attendance, Rewards, and Quorum: The discussion focused on the importance of establishing a quorum for meetings, especially as attendance has declined due to reduced rewards. Concerns were raised about how the current token price limits fair reward distribution. Suggestions included adjusting the number of members and how rewards are allocated to address past complaints.
