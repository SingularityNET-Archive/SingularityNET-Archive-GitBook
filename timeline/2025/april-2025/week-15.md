#### Discussion:
PRIORITIES AND BUDGET CONSTRAINTS
We discussed possible collaborations with spin-offs and other partners and how to deal with the current token prices which is at $0.16 today, half of what we calculated Q2 budget at. We considered different WGs past and intended collaborations, and Guillermo proposed that in future, we'd need to create a strategy that takes account of the effects of market price.
We came to the conclusion that everyone - spin-offs included - will be affected by the low token price. We also had discussions on who we have to reach out first in the program.

PRODUCT IDENTITY AND METHODOLOGIES 
We discussed various technical tools created by the workgroups and we thought of having to create different approach and methodologies on the tools created (We considered the idea of developing new approaches and methodologies for how these tools are used or improved). We also thought of how we can package that to share it with spin-offs and make it something that is to their advantage to use. We talked about having an independent research to look at different spin-offs that we have in the ecosystem and we’ll add a page to the current "Workgroups >< wider ecosystem collaborations" spreadsheet that outlines what we offer, which workgroup is it? What piece of tooling is it? And why a partner might need it. We decided to postpone the discussion on conducting independent research until more people have had the chance to share their input. 

ECOSYSTEM OVERVIEW AND WORKGROUP COORDINATION 
We emphasized the importance of understanding the needs of spin-offs and partners who we are offering our products too. We proposed a structured approach to document what each workgroup has built or made and what they could offer to their partners. We talked about the specific offerings that each Workgroup can offer to the ecosystem and we suggested forming a task force to streamline the process and the group will have a discussion on the next steps for outreach based on the compiled information.

PROJECTS AND COLLABORATION STRATEGIES 
We noted that there are a number of ongoing collaborations, and we decided to actively promote collaboration through targeted outreach, and during the meeting, we outlined the projects each workgroup is involved in, along with their current partnerships.

Tevo shared his perspective on the role of his workgroups, emphasizing that it's not just about offering tools or seeking direct collaborations with spin-offs. Instead, he sees value in co-developing experimental approaches to decentralization — an iterative process that adapts to emerging needs. He noted in the chat, “I still find my work to be relevant for improving decentralized autonomy and governance... but it’s unclear if SNET still pursues this path openly.” Drawing on past experience, he referenced the Catalyst Governance Guild’s early involvement in the Ambassador Program as an example of this experimental mindset, where the goal wasn’t to push fixed solutions but to stay responsive and adaptive. Effiom added to this by pointing out that beyond tools, the real asset lies in the skills and capabilities people bring to the table.

We noted that if any of the spin-offs start thinking about launching a product, we’d be there to support them.

Peter highlighted the alignment of various spin-offs with decentralization and the significance of community involvement (He noted that this shared foundation is encouraging, but also pointed out that each spin-off may have its own approach, so alignment isn’t guaranteed). The meeting wrapped up with reminders for Governance and Town-hall calls, alongside an invitation for participants to enter their workgroup information into the spreadsheet. 


#### Decision Items:
- Kizzy propose that REJUVE could have have a project showcase of their Rejuve app for live testing in the next AI sandbox call coming up this Thursday. 
  - [**rationale**] This could help in onboarding new members.

#### Keywords/tags:
- **topics covered:** BGI Nexus, Collaboration, spin-offs,  research, experiment, decentralized governance, Rejuve, tooling, Treasury, recordkeeping
- **emotions:** Organised, Discursive,  Collaborative, Resourceful,  forward-looking, Conclusive
