#### Narrative:
The Governance Workgroup discussed two major issues which are: Handling objections in decision-making and Dealing with budget cuts due to falling token prices.

We suggested a more structured way to address objections, either in meetings or asynchronously. Vani raised an issue about people consenting and not giving comments about why they are consenting. She feels it will be an issue amongst the workgroup. “People are not saying what they feel because we’ve gotten rid of anonymity”(Vani). Peter also stated that if people are objecting and not saying the reasons for their objections then the objection seems irrelevant. Peter offered to help facilitate discussions and improve communication with better note-taking.

We suggested that the ongoing nature of the feedback form could allow for further clarification from objectors. We also acknowledged that the removal of anonymity might be discouraging honest feedback.

Budget concerns were a big topic, as the group's Q2 budget dropped by 33%. We explored solutions like adjusting payment schedules or delaying payments until prices recover. Vani also pointed out that we shouldn’t respond to low token price by immediately going into volunteerism. We also noted that budget cuts were hurting participation, making governance harder to manage.

To improve discussions, We proposed unpaid facilitation to help members gain experience, but others worried this might lower attendance. A rotating facilitator system was considered to balance participation and budget concerns.

As the meeting ended, We focused on budget adjustments, clearer documentation, and the upcoming Town Hall for further discussions.





#### Discussion Points:
- How do we resolve workgroups that have objections?

- Is there a need to cut the governance workgroups Q2 budget?

- What will be the impact of the current token price on the governance workgroup budget?


#### Decision Items:
- We suggested that If a workgroup has objections, we’ll work with them to find a solution instead of simply stating there's no budget.
  - [**rationale**] It would be unsatisfactory to say that a workgroup doesn’t exit for the quarter.
  - [**opposing**] 

  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- There was a suggestion that we reduce expenses on Facilitating, documenting and on other tasks as well.
  - [**rationale**] This was because of the low token price and concerns around the budget.
  - [**opposing**] The Workgroup objected to the idea of not paying people for a work done. And noted that there should be a balance.
  - [**effect**] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- We decided to cut down the expenses on facilitation to Zero to help the workgroup understand their financial needs.
  - [**rationale**] The decision aims to preserve funds and reassess budget priorities, while adapting to market conditions.

### Governance Workgroup

- **Type of meeting:** Weekly
- **Present:** PeterE [**facilitator**], CallyFromAuron [**documenter**], PeterE, CallyFromAuron, UKnowZork, Tevo, LordKizzy, LadyTempestt, Effiom, Évéline Trinité, guillermolucero, Sucre n Spice, AshleyDawn
- **Purpose:** Weekly Open Governance session
- **Working Docs:**
  - [2nd round consent form Q2 budgets (Responses)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PPLz2LFADOziIb9cC3MNLPgrHAPlsui0XsrPdj1XcPs/edit?usp=sharing)
  - [budget decision - main issues mentioned in objections](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vzqhY_KDaE5l_4z_NVwr5aNFJKa6f71roslsg9Md0vU/edit?usp=sharing)
  - [Governance calls, rolling agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t39dwlwLYYB_1z_5szq1rnOH7mVTHe8Tmwv0R6ELOyE/edit?usp=sharing)

#### Narrative:
1) NUMBER AND VALIDITY OF RESPONSES IN THE 2nd ROUND CONSENT FORMS
In total there were 17 responses, but 1 was from someone who is not a Core Contributor, so it was deleted. 

2) HAVE THE BUDGETS OF THE REMAINING WGs PASSED?
Yes, all have been approved.
- African Guild: 11 consent, 2 object, 3 abstain.
- AI Sandbox/Think Tank: 13 consent, 0 object, 3 abstain.
- Education: 11 consent, 1 object, 4 abstain.
- Marketing: 9 consent, 1 object, 6 abstain.
- R&D: 11 consent, 2 object, 3 abstain.
- Writers: 10 consent, 1 object, 5 abstain.

Wr noted, however, that several of those who abstained/objected didn't comment to say why; and we noted a fairly high number of abstentions. Are people abstaining because they see it as a "soft" way to register an objection? Or because they are not anonymous? Tevo noted in Chat that he abstained to "all where I saw progress in reporting and budget, but was not quite yet harmless".

3) COMMENTS RAISED IN THE 2nd-ROUND CONSENT FORMS
We read through the consent forms, and noted 1) which objections from Round 1 people had said were still an issue, and 2) all the comments. 
There were severa l concerns that were about how people write their reports and budgets. We wondered whether there is a need for some sessions that look at this, and if so, whether Governance is the right place for it; but we didn't reach a conclusion.

4) HOW WILL WE TRACK THE CONCERNS RAISED?
Some of them may need further discussion, and/or for the WG concerned to take action. We decided how to address these issues so they are not forgotten about (see "decisions" below). 
We also noted that:
- Tevo can use PowerBI as usual to give stats and insights on the consent process; 
- Guillermo could in the long term try to develop his planned Consent Process dashboard to help us track issues raised in the consent process; although this would be difficult at present, because low token price means the scope of that project can't easily be extended.




#### Discussion Points:
- Number and validity of responses from 2nd-round consent form
- Have the budgets of the remaining 6 WGs in the 2nd round been approved or not?
- Going through the comments raised in the consent forms
- How will we track the concerns raised?

#### Decision Items:
- All the WGs' budgets are now approved
  - [**rationale**] because they all met the approval threshold of no more than 20% objection (not counting abstentions)
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- Where appropriate, we will add the issues raised in the consent form comments to the GovWG agenda for discussion in future meetings
  - [**opposing**] some discussion about whether Governance meetings is the right place for further discussion of how to write a good quarterly report
  - [**effect**] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- We will use the doc "budget decision - main issues mentioned in objections" to log issues that were raised in this consent process, and adapt the doc to note anything that should be tracked, e.g. if a WG said that it will address an issue in its next quarterly report.
  - [**rationale**] to ensure that issues don't get lost or forgotten.
  - [**effect**] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup

#### Action Items:
- [**action**] Vani to add issues mentioned in 2nd round consent forms to the Governance WG rolling agenda where applicable [**assignee**] CallyFromAuron [**due**] 8 April 2025 [**status**] todo
- [**action**] Vani to collate issues from this consent round in the "budget decision - main issues mentioned in objections" doc [**assignee**] CallyFromAuron [**due**] 8 April 2025 [**status**] todo
