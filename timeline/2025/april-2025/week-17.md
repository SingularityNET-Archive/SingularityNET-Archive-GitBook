#### Narrative:
Kick-off: The writers' workgroup weekly meeting commenced at 3:10 p.m. Kenichi reviewed the action items from the previous meeting. He announced that the Twitter premium plan had been activated and that the monthly Town Hall updates from January would be the first publication on X. Furthermore, Kenichi stated that the Web3 publishing platforms required additional attention and, to that end, requested that Cj Frankie and Gorga submit their first drafts.

DRAFTs: As agreed in the previous meeting, article suggestions will now be submitted via spreadsheet. In this meeting, Kenichi demonstrated the new writer's draft submission form, which streamlines the process. Writers can now suggest articles, include submission and preferred publication dates, and provide other relevant information. The form's integration with a Google Sheet simplifies tracking for the workgroup. Ines also recommended considering tools like Trello to further enhance workflow. In response to a question from Lady Tempestt, Kenichi confirmed that both writers and scribes will have access to the submission form. Once a draft is approved, the scribes will submit it to the community page. Kenichi will coordinate with Peter to pin the form link to the writer's channel for easy access.

Role document: Ines inquired about the new role document and its associated thresholds. Kenichi clarified that the document would be accessible this quarter and that there would be no penalties for not meeting any outlined expectations. He explained that the document's purpose is to track Scribblers' progress over time, enabling the workgroup to make informed decisions, such as whether or not to onboard new members.

Ambassador program website: In this meeting, Ines proposed the idea of creating a platform or WordPress for the workgroup, where all information about what we do can be easily accessed! Kenichi then revealed that he is collaborating with the R&D guild to develop an ambassador program website. This site will house comprehensive information about all participating workgroups, each of which will have its dedicated page with updated access.
