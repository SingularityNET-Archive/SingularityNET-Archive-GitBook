#### Town Hall Summary:
#### Mentions
- The last 2 Town Halls had very low attendance, so it was decided not to upload videos to Youtube.
- Congratulations to Ayomi's team, who succeeded in the recent Deepfunding RFP ideation round with Deep Funding University Network project.  
- Any Q4 quarterly reports still outstanding should be submitted as soon as possible via the Governance Dashboard, since the deadline has technically already passed.
- Rejuve airdrop 4th epoch is now live - for those who held AGIX at the time of the hardfork in 2021

#### End-of-year schedule: 
- next week (16th December) will be the last Town Hall of the year.
- All Workgroups should check that the calendar accurately reflects their meeting dates (if any) over the holidays. 
- We'll be writing an end-of-year report, basing it on the impact statements that WGs have given in their Q4 reports. 
- Over the holidays. people are encouraged to contribute to the open document on ideas for restructuring the program, and the planned one-to-one interviews about restructuring will be conducted by members of Gov WG, aminly with people who rarely attend Governance meetings
- Treasury may swkip a couple of weeks over the holiday period if few payments are submitte for payment

#### Annual end-of-year sentiment analysis session
In Governance WG earlier today, we used Miro board https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVJh1rXXQ=/ to discuss the same questions as at previous year-ends - how well do we organise our repetitions, how predictable is our funding, do we gather often enough, how well do we organise our reputation-building, do we have clear principles and roadmap, and have we established a good environment. 
In comparison with previous years, there was a difference in focus around the questions themselves; and the sentiment was more negative and showed a strong wish for change. But we didn't have time to analyse the reasons - possibly it's partly influenced by all the recent discussion of restructuring the program? 
In this TH we did a prioritisation activity to decide which 3 questions are the most important for further discussion. The results: (how well do we organise our repetitions), Q4 (how well do we organise our reputation-building) and Q5 (do we have clear principles and roadmap).

#### Collecting feedback on Gov-Dash and AI Assistant
Guillermo will be creating a video documentary to capture insights from the experiment of using the AI assistant in the Governance Dashboard. People are invited to create a short video answering the questions in this doc https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i2dZkk8FykfVZ45ILeSRgC6zexqNW0g7d4fZVR3JPRU/edit?usp=sharing, and the videos will be edited together. People can also answer in writing in the doc itself. Deadline for contributions; Friday 12th Dec. Contributions do not necessarily have to be positive.

Reminder that Thursday's governance slot will be a final report from the temporary fundraising workgroup.

#### Decision Items:
- Knowledge graph development: see 
- https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/285 (Nov 2025)  and 
- https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/287 (Dec 2025)

Key focus recently has been is prototyping a replacement Archives dashboard, and thereby  improving the data ingestion pipeline. Initial work on ingesting data from multiple sources into a Supabase schema has been completed, so we know it works; a prototype RAG system has been built using a minimal local LLM to parse data from a discrete source (sample JSON data from this year only); and a draft Discord bot capable of generating answers with verifiable citations.

  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- This work is now on hold while we protoype an actual redesigned Archives dashboard that puts summary submission, Archives corpus, a decision tracker, and graph RAG material all in one interface. This is based on forking André's original dashboard, and aiming to make it more generic, rather than specific to the needs of the Ambassador program; and improving its documentation (e.g. what terms mean, how authentication is set up, how our data is structured, etc).

  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We noted, RE the setup of the RAG process - there is a lot of token overhead involved in just "throwing JSON at a generative model" - much more efficient to pre-query with SQL, creating a subsection of the data, and sending only that to the generative model.  Same approach will be used with graph queries - SQL first.

  - [**rationale**] Requires differentiating semantic queries (i.e. queries that are more suited to a RAG process) from queries that are better suited to SQL (e.g. arithmetic /counting type questions, etc). Some natural language processing could help identify what kind of query is being asked, and what process is best suited to answer it; i.e. by identifying different types of queries, and matching actual queries against these "types".
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We noted that a key element of our approach is that if the RAG cannot answer a question/iderntify a source, it will *say so*, rather than making something up

  - [**rationale**] so that answers are auditable/verifiable.
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We agreed that in early 2026, we will run a session as discussed in October to engage the wider Ambassador community with analyzing the graph data and verifying it/ analysing what it means, comparing its insights to their lived experience of being in the Ambassador program.

  - [**rationale**] Both as a way of developing a community verification process for graph outputs, and as a way of educating on basic graph analysis.
  - [**effect**] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- We noted that one aim of the new dashboard is that it will be modular - and that it will be able to ingest *any* JSON or SQL data (i.e. not necessarily just meeting summaries); it will then be important for it to be able to understand how the different data sources are related to each other. 

However, ethically speaking, we don't necessarily want to assume what the connections are - it's important that a human in the loop should be *discovering* how things are connected, rather than allowing the graph RAG process to assume connections. 

- We notd that rational privacy (as for Cardano's Midnight chain) is important in an archival context - also the need to be clear about what info is public, and what consents are needed. 

  - [**rationale**] We discussed whether consent needs to be be retrospective: i.e. a person cannot know in advance how AI might use and process their data, or what insights it might come up with, so perhaps they can only give fully informed consent once they see and verify the outputs? (in a similar way to how an interview subject can only fully consent after the interview is finished and they know what they have said)
  - [**effect**] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- We noted that for this Quarter, there is no budget consent process; but WGs are being asked for a simple, minimal report on their work; we have submitted Archives' report to the Governance Dashboard here https://singularitynet-governance-dashboard.vercel.app/dashboard/proposals/cmixenh0m0001jv0ao0ccwgl3

#### Action Items:

## Thursday 11th December 2025

### African Guild

- **Type of meeting:** Biweekly
- **Present:** Sucre n Spice [**facilitator**], UKnowZork [**documenter**], Sucre n Spice, UKnowZork, Kateri, AndrewBen, Kevin Frey, Alfred Itodele
- **Purpose:** Bi-weekly Meeting of the African Guild
- **Working Docs:**
  - [SNET African Guild Q4 initiative](https://docs.google.com/presentation/u/0/d/1oV-pOLn2NyLvAcdBHnscmTu-E1B-a1Fdm3VNY5BlN4U/mobilepresent?pli=1&slide=id.g3afa51893dd_0_21)

#### Narrative:
Intro: The meeting opened with SucrenSpice welcoming everyone and explained that the session was meant to reflect on the quarter’s activities and showcase what the African Guild achieved despite funding and logistical constraints. SucrenSpice briefly restated the guild’s mission: advancing decentralized AI adoption, education, and innovation across Africa. The focus then shifted to reviewing the initiatives planned for Q4 and assessing what was completed.
                       

Highlights / Upcoming events
The SNET Impact challenge was highlighted as one of the quarter’s biggest successes. Kateri shared that her role involved background support, while Ese worked directly with participants. The challenge received about 12 submissions showcasing how Africans are using AI, generated strong social media engagement, and attracted new members to SingularityNet. We agreed that the quality of submissions, especially those focused on education, was encouraging. 

The Talking Drum Dispatch was discussed next. Martinsoki led the November edition, which covered AI innovations across Africa, SingularityNet updates, AI governance training in Kenya, and an Angolan logistics company using AI. The December edition is currently in progress, and members were encouraged to read and engage with the shared dispatch. Next we discussed the virtual event hosted and held in Abuja. 
The village meeting was described as a standout event. Although most people  couldn’t attend due to distance, reports and videos showed strong impact, with around 45 new participants introduced to SingularityNet. The culturally grounded, in-person format was widely praised as one of the guild’s best events so far.

Updates were also given on ongoing and postponed initiatives. The community Twitter/X Space is still in progress due to login issues and may take place soon or move into the new year. Cross-guild collaboration with the LATAM guild and the planned AI video content were moved to the next quarter because of funding and availability challenges.

Looking ahead:
We discussed plans for 2026, focusing on sustaining and scaling successful initiatives, expanding the reach of the Talking Drum Dispatch, growing the guild’s presence in academic institutions and tech communities, and organizing more workshops to to simplify decentralized AI and make SingularityNet more accessible across Africa.


AOB: 
UknowZork asked about the short AI videos that were planned for the quarter and SucrenSpice confirmed that the team assigned to the task had been unavailable and that the initiative would be moved to Q1, with funds still intact. With no further questions, the meeting was wrapped up.
