#### In this meeting we discussed:
- Meeting Coordination: The session kicked off with osmium welcoming everyone who joined.
- BGI-25: 
Vani outlined plans for the upcoming BGI-25 Virtual Unconference event, 23rd October. She invited AI Sandbox/Think Tank to take part in the planned session on AI tooling for community governance, together with R&D< Archives and African Guild. We would have a 3 minutes time slot to make a presentation, then engage with questions and comments from the floor. Whoever gives the presentation should have a good internet connection.

We could also suggest any other session we might like to present.  Vasu suggested a round table, open discussion on his work on DAO structures for governing AI; everyone agreed.

Budget for this work is coming directly from the foundation.
