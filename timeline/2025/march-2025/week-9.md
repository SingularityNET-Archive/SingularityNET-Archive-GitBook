# Week 09

## Saturday 1st March 2025

### Gamers Guild

- **Type of meeting:** Biweekly
- **Present:** Slate [**facilitator**], devon [**documenter**], Malik, rebel, LordKizzy, Gorga Siagian, martinsoki, Slate
- **Purpose:** The purpose of this Gamers Guild meeting was to review ongoing workgroup progress, demonstrate a customizable user interface (UI) for in-game dashboards, finalize the upcoming budget request, and showcase a new building model for the Ambassador VR environment.
- **Working Docs:**

#### Discussion Points:
- Education Guild Updates by Malik:

Demonstrated additional NPC animations (waving, torso movements) and new assets such as planning boards, laptops, and infographics.
Discussed the possibility of removing unused staircases to reduce building size and complexity.
- UI Dashboard Demonstration by Slate:

Showed a fully interactive UI system that can display data, open sub-windows, and animate transitions in-game (e.g., for treasury dashboards, budget planners, or project documentation).
Provided a simple code template that creators can copy into their own Roblox projects, customizing text labels, buttons, and event scripts.
- Budget Request Overview:

Budget constraints prompted cuts to certain tasks (e.g., fewer asset creation slots, lower caps on retrospective guidance).
Slate Proposed a flexible payout policy: if AGIX price dips too low, pay monthly rather than bi-weekly, shifting back to more frequent payouts if the token price recovers.
- Report Creation Task:

Rebel volunteered to write the upcoming quarterly report. A preliminary draft is expected by the following Wednesday.
Workgroup creators must submit brief (30–60 second) progress videos for inclusion in the report.
- Ambassador VR Building by Kizzy:

Showcased a new administrative block design suitable for a university-like environment (offices, meeting rooms, waiting areas).
Feedback included adding a functionality script (e.g., a cafeteria or interactive feature) and refining staircases and NPC animations.

#### Decision Items:
- Flexible Payout Schedule approved depending on AGIX price volatility; monthly payouts replace bi-weekly if the token value remains low.
  - [**effect**] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- Budget Request adjustments (fewer asset creation slots, reduced guidance costs) confirmed for the next quarter, with room to scale if AGIX recovers.
