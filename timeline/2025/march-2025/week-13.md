#### Narrative:
Peter reviewed the objections that were discussed in the last meeting, noting that some may need further discussion before moving to the consent process. 

Guillermo talked about the importance of not delaying decisions because the objector is not present. Vani noted that we have already started moving with or without Tevo being present.

Peter highlighted the questions asked in the last meeting:
- Whether to consolidate objections or keep them separate in the consent form?
- Can we, in a governance meeting, deem a particular objection invalid ?

Lordkizzy presented that André has withdrawn his objection to AI Sandbox/Thnk Tank. We agreed to ask André to add a note in the Responses spreadsheet tp say this, and he did so during the meeting.

Vani asked what we plan to do if a workgroup doesn’t get the required 80% consent in the 2nd round. We agreed that the workgroup should be able to continue to try to reach a resolution, rather than simply having no budget for Q2.
Lord kizzy noted that we should track the objections to know which has been addressed and which has not.

Guillermo spoke that we shouldn’t consolidate all the objections on a WG in the form, as it will make it difficult to be clear what someone is actually objecting to 
Lord kizzy suggested that we should add a question in the form that asks "Overall, do you consent to this WG's budget?" and then ask which, if any, of the objections from round 1 are still a concern. This would allow people to indicate if certain objections had not been satisfactorily addressed, even if on balance they consent to the WG's budget overall.

There was a brief discussion on workgroup autonomy, in relation to the objection to African Guild's charging $25 for facilitation when the objector felt that $20 was standard. Many felt that such objections interfered with workgroup autonomy; and it was noted that there is not actually any agreed "standard" price. Nevertheless, we agreed not to ruke the objection as invalid, but to let it go to the 2nd-round consent process.

Clement raised concerns about the objection to African Guild in relation to reward distribution; he questioned whether it is true that rewards were being allocated solely based on meeting attendance rather than task performance and noted that token price fluctuations were limiting workgroup innovation.

Peter expressed caution about spending reserves when token prices are low, the idea of using reserves to support workgroup functions during downturns was tabled for another discussion. 

We discussed exactly what the "80-20% rule" means, and how we calculate whether a WG has passed the threshold - do they need 80% consent or above 80%? or is it better to look at the threshold as "no more than 20% objection"? And 80%/20% of what? Is it all those who participated, or are abstainers not counted? See "Decisions" below.




#### Discussion Points:
- Whether to list each objection separately in the consent form, or consolidate them. 
- How to prevent new objections from being raised in the 2nd consent round 
- What the 80%/20% rule means in practice - do WGs need more than 80% consent, or is it no more than 20% objections? The challenge of calculating percentages when some members abstain.

#### Decision Items:
- We will ask objectors to review the shared documentation (WGs will each write a document addressing the objections they have received) before the 2nd consent round opens, and formally withdraw objections if they feel the issues have been resolved.
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- The 2nd round consent form will ask people to consent, object or abstain to a Workgroup budget as a whole, before asking for their views on the individual objections from Round 1.

  - [**rationale**] Will be clearer, and will allow people to consent overall, even if they feel that some of the objections are still a concern.
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We will keep the different objections separate, and ask people which ones, if any, they think are a problem. 
  - [**rationale**] This will enable us to identify which objections need to be discussed further (in general terms, rather than in relation to whether or not a WG gets its budget) once the consent process is over.
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We are not going to rule any objections invalid 
  - [**rationale**] This meeting is perhaps not well-attended enough to give a real consensus that an objection should be overruled. It would be better to let them all go through the 2nd consent round and see which ones Core Contributors agree are an issue. 
- The 80-20% rule means a Workgroup will pass unless **more than 20%** of those taking part object. As always, the “number taking part” excludes abstainers

#### Action Items:
- [**action**] Vani will modify the Round 2 consent form to include “consent” “object” and “abstain” on the budget as a whole, plus a question on which, if any, outstanding objections the person thinks are still a problem. [**assignee**] CallyFromAuron [**due**] 1 April 2025 [**status**] todo
