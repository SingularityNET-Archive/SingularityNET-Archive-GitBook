## Tuesday 25th March 2025

### Governance Workgroup

- **Type of meeting:** Weekly
- **Present:** CallyFromAuron [**facilitator**], CallyFromAuron [**documenter**], guillermolucero, CallyFromAuron, LordKizzy, LadyTempestt, AshleyDawn, Évéline Trinite, UknowZork
- **Purpose:** regular weekly GovWG meeting
- **Working Docs:**
  - [Consent form, Q2 2025 budgets (Responses)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s6Uy3ZsPwAZUM094ENN3kqXugU5xUaZpxYdqfaDy7rk/edit?usp=sharing)

#### Narrative:
RESOLVING OBJECTIONS?
Most of the objections are Tevo's; so because he was unable to be at this meeting, we were unable to try to resolve them.

We looked at the one other objection (by Vani, objecting to Writers' WG on the grounds of over-centralisation). Mikasa gave a defence saying that they have already planned to address the problem - but as this is exactly what was said last time the issue arose, Vani preferred not to resolve the objection, but to let it go to the consent process. So Writers' WG will address this in their "response" doc.

There were no other objections by anyone other than Tevo.

CAN WE RULE ANY OBJECTIONS INVALID?
We discussed whether we, as Governance WG, can rule any of the objections as "invalid", as was done in previous rounds. For example, the objection to African Guild that they pay $25 per meeting for facilitation when the objector believes there should be a standard fee of $20 across the Program - we noted that there is no longer any agreed, enforcable "standard fee", and that trying to impose one retroactively could infringe on the idea of workgroup autonomy, so this could therefore be considered an invalid objection. However, since Tevo isn't able to be here to discuss it, perhaps we should not rule out any objections as "invalid", but should let all the objections go to the 2nd consent round - if individuals feel an objection is not valid, they will select "objection has been addressed or is not an issue". 
This question will be looked at again in Thursday's meeting to confirm that we do not plan to rule any onbjection "invalid" at this stage.

ARE OBJECTIONS INVALID IF THEY WERE NOT SUBMITTED IN THE "WHAT IS YOUR OBJECTION" FIELD?
We noted that some of the objections in the responses sheet were actually submitted in the "What would need to change?" field, so it's not 100% clear that they are objections as such. (Example - the objection mentioned above, about African Guild paying $25 for documentation.) However, it is pretty clear from context that they are intended as objections.

SEPARATE THE INDIVIDUAL OBJECTIONS OUT?
The draft 2nd-round consent form created by Vani separates each individual objection (even if it's part of a set of several points that were made by the same person), and asks people to agree / disagree with each one separately.

LordKizzy suggested that instead, we should give all the objections to a particular WG together, and ask people "In the light of the above, do you consent or object to this WG's budget?"
This might make the consenting process easier; but it might also mean that if someone only agrees with one of the objections, we won't know which one.
This question will be looked at again in Thursday's meeting.

WHAT DOES "80/20" MEAN IN PRACTICE?
We noted that it's not completely clear what the 80/20% rule means in this context.
First - do abstentions count towards the total "number of people who took part"? Is it "80%/20% including abstentions" or not?
Second - to pass, does a WG need at least 80% of respondents saying "this has been resolved, or is not an issue", or fewer than 20% saying "this is still a problem"?
This question will be looked at again in Thursday's meeting.

WHAT HAPPENS IF A WG'S BUDGET DOESN'T PASS?
We realised that we have not definitely confirmed what the approach is this round.
Will that be it - no budget?
Or will there be any further attempts to resolve the situation?
This question will be looked at again in Thursday's meeting


#### Discussion Points:
- Running through the outstanding objections to see if there were any we could resolve
- Can we, in a Governance meeting, deem a particular objection invalid? 
- Should the 2nd round consent form list each objection separately, or should we consolidate them?
- What does the 80/20% rule mean in practice in this context?

#### Decision Items:
- We agreed that in Thursday's meeting, we need further discussion of the following:
- Can we, in a Governance meeting, deem a particular objection invalid? 
- Should the 2nd round consent form list each objection separately, or should we consolidate them?
- What does the 80/20% rule mean in practice in this context?
  - [**rationale**] These issues were raised in today's meeting, but we didn't have time to reac firm conclusions.
  - [**effect**] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup

  - [SingularityNET AI Marketplace Knowledge & Engagement Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSea1U_MsXS1La3B8y1HXHaINpTh5D1ri0SeuPA_qvX0hSZNRg/viewform?usp=dialog)

  - [Q2 WG Budget Minimums](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17a0CssxFOtK_Pd4Q-wMtBfMGJfVVtJlwjCTbbFmUBCE/edit?gid=0#gid=0)

#### Narrative:
Intro: The call opened with Ayo asking UknowZork how she’s been coping, especially since many of the guild meetings have now shifted to a bi-weekly schedule. He also asked if she’s been getting or taking up tasks.
UknowZork shared that she’s been able to pick up small documentation tasks and is hopeful for more opportunities. Ayo encouraged her, noting that consistent participation and attending calls is the best approach. He asked if UknowZork attends AI Sandbox calls, as they’re a great space for learning and growth.
Ayo mentioned that the meeting would proceed as planned, though it might be shorter due to fewer attendees. He asked everyone to wait a couple of minutes while he prepared the updates.
There was a light moment when Ayo joked about mixing up who’s based where, sharing how he recently visited Uyo and Calabar but wasn’t sure who from the team lived there.
Finally, Ayo said he would share the agenda on screen and suggested using the last meeting’s agenda summary as a base since no new notes had been posted yet.
 


Q2 Updates / Workshop / approach / Research & May TownHall Presentation

Ayo shared details about the survey form and shared that since they hadn’t been getting much feedback before, the team had decided to change their strategy. Instead of trying to get input during the guild meetings or workshops, like they had originally planned, they’re now shifting to a more direct approach. The plan is to reach out to people individually with specific questions, gather their responses, analyze the data, and then send back the results. He explained that the challenge right now is figuring out exactly who to contact in each guild. For example, in the African Guild, they need to identify three reliable members—people who still show up consistently for calls, even with the token price drop. This way, they can be sure they’ll get the responses they need.

Ayo also gave an update on the Q2 research, noting that it’s a continuation of the Q1 work. They’re partnering with Deep Funding and have already compiled a list of documents that he had previously shared with Deep Funding. The main challenge has been figuring out which guild circles to focus on. At first, it seemed like the research was for the IT circle, then it looked like the Review circle, then Data Analytics, and finally Operations. Since Ayo wasn’t able to attend the April meeting, he mentioned it might be a good idea to attend the May one for more clarity. He also pointed out that for the Q3 budget, it’s already known that the token price has dropped, and there will be cuts to the budget for each workgroup or guild. For instance, Strata Guild is now set to receive $861, which is adjusted to 2,868 AGX tokens at the current rate of $0.3 per AGX. So, the budgets are definitely tighter. He expressed some uncertainty about the research project—whether it’s happening at all. With the end of May approaching and only a few weeks left in the quarter, time is running out. Clement added his thoughts, saying that this was the original vision—getting people who are active in the whole AI market space so they could collect more expansive data for fresh perspectives on the analysis. He also took a moment to appreciate the effort of the research team.




AOB: Ayo expressed some uncertainty about the research project—whether it’s happening at all. With the end of May approaching and only a few weeks left in the quarter, time is running out.

Jeffery brought up the next steps for the research, reminding Ayo that he had mentioned including him as part of the research team, but he hadn’t heard anything since. Ayo apologized for the communication gap, admitting he hadn’t been very active on Discord lately and hadn’t seen any clear details about including him as part of the research team. After reviewing past conversations, he didn’t find much concrete information and suggested there might have been a misunderstanding or missing context. In a lighthearted moment, Ayo even joked that if he had said Jeffery was on the research team, he must have been “really drunk,” as Jeffery isn’t a core member of the Guild.

To smooth things over, Ayo reassured him that he would double-check the meeting details and do a follow up with him. Kateri also mentioned she had some pending messages that hadn’t been addressed yet. Ayo apologized again and promised to get back to her after the call.

The meeting wrapped up with Ayo encouraging both Kateri and Jeffery to reach out so they could clarify things and move forward together.

## Thursday 27th March 2025


### Governance Workgroup

- **Type of meeting:** Weekly
- **Present:** PeterE [**facilitator**], Kateri, CallyFromAuron [**documenter**], guillermolucero, CallyFromAuron, LordKizzy, LadyTempestt, AshleyDawn, Évéline Trinite, UknowZork, Kateri, PeterE, Clement Umoh, advanceameyaw, Alfred, martinsoki, Mikasa, Sucre n Spice, Jeffrey
- **Purpose:** Weekly Open Governance meeting
- **Working Docs:**
  - [Consent form, Q2 2025 budgets (Responses)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s6Uy3ZsPwAZUM094ENN3kqXugU5xUaZpxYdqfaDy7rk/edit?usp=sharing)

#### Narrative:
Peter reviewed the objections that were discussed in the last meeting, noting that some may need further discussion before moving to the consent process. 

Guillermo talked about the importance of not delaying decisions because the objector is not present. Vani noted that we have already started moving with or without Tevo being present.

Peter highlighted the questions asked in the last meeting:
- Whether to consolidate objections or keep them separate in the consent form?
- Can we, in a governance meeting, deem a particular objection invalid ?

Lordkizzy presented that André has withdrawn his objection to AI Sandbox/Thnk Tank. We agreed to ask André to add a note in the Responses spreadsheet tp say this, and he did so during the meeting.

Vani asked what we plan to do if a workgroup doesn’t get the required 80% consent in the 2nd round. We agreed that the workgroup should be able to continue to try to reach a resolution, rather than simply having no budget for Q2.
Lord kizzy noted that we should track the objections to know which has been addressed and which has not.

Guillermo spoke that we shouldn’t consolidate all the objections on a WG in the form, as it will make it difficult to be clear what someone is actually objecting to 
Lord kizzy suggested that we should add a question in the form that asks "Overall, do you consent to this WG's budget?" and then ask which, if any, of the objections from round 1 are still a concern. This would allow people to indicate if certain objections had not been satisfactorily addressed, even if on balance they consent to the WG's budget overall.

There was a brief discussion on workgroup autonomy, in relation to the objection to African Guild's charging $25 for facilitation when the objector felt that $20 was standard. Many felt that such objections interfered with workgroup autonomy; and it was noted that there is not actually any agreed "standard" price. Nevertheless, we agreed not to ruke the objection as invalid, but to let it go to the 2nd-round consent process.

Clement raised concerns about the objection to African Guild in relation to reward distribution; he questioned whether it is true that rewards were being allocated solely based on meeting attendance rather than task performance and noted that token price fluctuations were limiting workgroup innovation.

Peter expressed caution about spending reserves when token prices are low, the idea of using reserves to support workgroup functions during downturns was tabled for another discussion. 

We discussed exactly what the "80-20% rule" means, and how we calculate whether a WG has passed the threshold - do they need 80% consent or above 80%? or is it better to look at the threshold as "no more than 20% objection"? And 80%/20% of what? Is it all those who participated, or are abstainers not counted? See "Decisions" below.




#### Discussion Points:
- Whether to list each objection separately in the consent form, or consolidate them. 
- How to prevent new objections from being raised in the 2nd consent round 
- What the 80%/20% rule means in practice - do WGs need more than 80% consent, or is it no more than 20% objections? The challenge of calculating percentages when some members abstain.

#### Decision Items:
- We will ask objectors to review the shared documentation (WGs will each write a document addressing the objections they have received) before the 2nd consent round opens, and formally withdraw objections if they feel the issues have been resolved.
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- The 2nd round consent form will ask people to consent, object or abstain to a Workgroup budget as a whole, before asking for their views on the individual objections from Round 1.

  - [**rationale**] Will be clearer, and will allow people to consent overall, even if they feel that some of the objections are still a concern.
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We will keep the different objections separate, and ask people which ones, if any, they think are a problem. 
  - [**rationale**] This will enable us to identify which objections need to be discussed further (in general terms, rather than in relation to whether or not a WG gets its budget) once the consent process is over.
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We are not going to rule any objections invalid 
  - [**rationale**] This meeting is perhaps not well-attended enough to give a real consensus that an objection should be overruled. It would be better to let them all go through the 2nd consent round and see which ones Core Contributors agree are an issue. 
- The 80-20% rule means a Workgroup will pass unless **more than 20%** of those taking part object. As always, the “number taking part” excludes abstainers 

  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople

#### Action Items:
- [**action**] Vani will modify the Round 2 consent form to include “consent” “object” and “abstain” on the budget as a whole, plus a question on which, if any, outstanding objections the person thinks are still a problem. [**assignee**] CallyFromAuron [**due**] 1 April 2025 [**status**] todo

#### In this meeting we discussed:
- Meeting Coordination and Introduction: The meeting kicked off with LordKizzy, focusing on the exploration of AI tools and projects.

- LordKizzy mentioned that he received the last meeting documentation from Santos but found some errors. He provided feedback for corrections and is hopeful that the necessary adjustments will be made. 
LordKizzy gave a brief explanation on the AI Sandbox/Think-tank WG to the new members.
- Discussion on ASI LLM:
Osmium provided insights into the ASI LLM, the first Web3 native LLM designed for agentic AI, optimized for complex interactions and autonomous decision-making. He explained its integration with the ASI Wallet for secure transactions and its advanced reasoning capabilities, which are expected to impact sectors like DeFi and supply chain management. Osmium detailed the process for integrating ASI into applications via a robust API, emphasizing the benefits of operating within a Web3 ecosystem, including enhanced security and anonymity. He also mentioned the potential for ASI's integration with decentralized networks and indicated that further instructions on API key generation would be provided in future sessions. 
Osmium led a discussion on the integration of AI governance tools into decentralized organizations, highlighting the importance of ethics and community participation. He raised concerns about the implications of solving complex mathematical problems, such as the P vs NP question, which could lead to significant security vulnerabilities. Advanceameyaw contributed by suggesting the exploration of general mathematical questions to test AI capabilities.
Osmium highlighted the functionalities of modular agents and their integration with Llama 3 during the discussion.

He highlighted the importance of collaboration with the African Guild and mentioned the upcoming Ubuntu and AI conference, emphasizing the need for improved marketing support compared to last year.

### Gamers Guild

- **Type of meeting:** Weekly
- **Present:** Slate [**facilitator**], devon [**documenter**], Malik, rebel, LordKizzy, SubZero, sirxalfred, AshleyDawn, Slate
- **Purpose:** Demonstrate a live, in‑game link to the Ambassador‑Program Budget Planner, discuss severe budget constraints and a revised meeting cadence, and collect progress updates from active workgroup and map‑creators.
- **Working Docs:**

#### Discussion Points:
- Live Budget‑Planner UI by Slate:

Demo included a scrolling ambassador program budget planner GUI in Roblox showing that refreshes every few seconds; edits in the google sheet (e.g., Treasury Guild request changed from $6013 to $7000) appeared in‑game in real time.

Next steps: add quarter tabs, colour‑coded thresholds, and deliver a call with Treasury Guild (Kizzy mentor) once fully polished.
- LLM Knowledge‑Base Concept by Slate: 

Proposed hosting a private LLM containing step‑by‑step build guides, UI templates, and common troubleshooting so creators can self‑serve without waiting for live help.
- Budget Outlook & Cadence Change

Q2 allocation: 7 000 AGIX ≈ $1540 at today’s $0.22 price.

To stay solvent, meeting‑related line items (hosting, facilitation, docs, publicity, gaming rewards) will be cut roughly in half by switching from bi‑weekly to monthly guild meetings (three per quarter).

Revised monthly costs save ≈ $540, letting the guild operate within $1540

Asset‑creation payouts remain paused except five one‑per‑person this month.
- Writers Work Group & Admin Block by Kizzy: 

Admin Block: added reception screens, meeting rooms, improved stairs, 20+ NPCs. Will integrate a FAQ dialogue system and possibly a payment/document‑submission feature.

Writers WG Building: added onboarding room, social‑media offices, cafeteria, study room, and scrolling Twitter dashboards; proposes MCQ entry test and rotating book icons.

Received help debugging object spin and agreed to anchor icons & save property changes.
- Asset‑Creation Task

Reopened for five submissions; creators may post short videos for voting in the guild channel.

#### Decision Items:
- Meeting frequency changed to monthly (next on 26 April) until AGIX recovers
  - [**rationale**] Low Agix price 

#### Action Items:
- [**action**] Map Creators  [**assignee**] Gorga Siagian, Kateri [**due**] 26 April 2025 [**status**] in progress
