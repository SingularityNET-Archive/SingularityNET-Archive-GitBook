#### Narrative:
Meeting Schedule and Research Updates

Ayo outlined the new meeting schedule, which includes one meeting per month, with the first meeting on April 14th, followed by meetings on May 26th and June 30th. Daniel contributed to the discussion by confirming the dates and emphasizing the importance of workshops in between meetings. Action items were assigned to ensure that the schedule is communicated effectively.

Research Focus on AI Marketplace Awareness

Ayo emphasized the need for ambassadors of SNET to be aware of the AI solutions available in the marketplace, as part of a research initiative to assess their knowledge. Clement's engaging presentation on this subject led to plans for him to present again at the deep funding town hall. Ayo also encouraged members to consider potential research topics for Q2.

Decision Reminders and Asynchronous Unit Members

Ese Williams led a discussion on decision reminders for Q2, confirming the monthly meeting and the need for new asynchronous unit members. Ayo emphasized the importance of selecting the right candidates for these roles, expressing concerns about the challenges of asynchronous communication. Daniel Effiom noted that while three members are usually selected, only two would be needed for project six, and he encouraged nominations from the group.

Core Membership Discussion and Q1 Wrap-Up

Ayo outlined the steps for announcing core membership opportunities and conducting a poll to gauge interest. He encouraged newcomers, including Jeffrey, to engage in the Strategy Guild's channel on Discord for better communication. Ayo also highlighted that active involvement in other work groups is necessary for those seeking core membership.

Clarification of the process for becoming a core member within the guild.

Workshop Planning and Feedback

Ayo suggested organizing a workshop for the next quarter that would incorporate insights from the African and Latham Guilds while considering collaboration with the European Guild. Daniel pointed out difficulties in attendance for the current workshop and proposed a new strategy that involves visiting guild members in their own environments. The team expressed consensus on the need to enhance their approach for the next quarter's workshop.
