#### Narrative:
Advance and Clement have drafted a report on the ETHiopia conference, which they will share in the Open Governance meeting this Thurs (6th March).

Dates for forthcoming sessions: 
- the retrospective on the Q2 decision will be on Tues 1st April
- initial meeting on budget minimums on Thurs 3rd April. Vani, Peter, Sucre and Effiom to plan it; Vani to make a Discord group to discuss it.

Other possible sessions for future Governance meetings: 
- 1) We noted that Education Guild are planning to take on some educational sessions on governance issues - Vasu, Lord KIzzy and Vani are planning the sessions now, covering the core governance mechanisms in the Program - so this will cover the longstanding agenda item we have had about whether Governance WG itself should be undertaking governance education sessions

- 2) Kevin suggested a meeting with Mindplex - we decided this might not make so much sense as a Governance session, so Kevin will organise this outside of Governance meetings, perhaps under Marketing.

- 3) Tevo suggested discussing contribution systems, and who contributes - what are the patterns in the data we have, for example who are the "high cost individuals", and should we aim to decentralise further on fund distribution? Others said that perhaps it's OK if "high-cost individuals" are those who are prepared to do the most work. Also - look at the ratio of amount of work (in terms of MINS) vs amount earned in AGIX

- 4) we do need to discuss how to raise the issue of if/when a WG's outputs are felt to be low-quality. What should the pathway be for raising it?


End of Year Report: anything still to be added should be done by this Friday (7th); then Vani will proofread over the weekend.





#### Discussion Points:
- Calculating Core Contributors for Q2
- Signing off Q2 consent form
- Ideas and dates for future Governance sessions (including Mindplex/outreach to the rest of the ecosystem, Governance education; Contribution systems)
- End-Of-Year report 2024

#### Decision Items:
- We agreed it's time to calculate who is a Core Contributor for Q2 - Tevo will do it later today and post the results in the Governance Discord channel
  - [**rationale**] allows time for people to nominate anyone who doesn't quite meet the criteria
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We signed off the Q2 decision consent form
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We agreed we need to discuss how to raise the issue of if/when a WG's outputs are felt to be low-quality. 
  - [**rationale**] Because it's an issue that needs to be discussed, but it can be sensitive, and there is no clear pathway for how to bring it up.

  - [GitHub Issue for this meeting](https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/247)

#### Decision Items:
- Last meeting, we said that we would review, in this meeting, whether or not we can afford to implement the proposed initiative for this Quarter to create a skilled documentation team. 

Unfortunately token price is even lower than it was, so we definitely cannot do it - but we noted that the need for it might be obviated by our proposed experiment with not correcting summaries in Q2.

We agreed to close the Issue https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/235
  - [**rationale**] We had this in our Q1 budget: "If token price rises sufficiently above $0.55" (the exchange rate at which Q1 budgets were calculated). Price has dropped.
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- Our Quarterly Report draft https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/231 and Q2 budget draft https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BLCkYgyV0rnt-Ntlqp_DXGCm1t3KieAVMS_HaUamqQI/edit?usp=sharing were signed off
  - [**rationale**] Needs to be submitted on 10th March
  - [**effect**] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- André, tool development: see https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/248
This month the Autosave feature has been completed, and bug fixes have been done

  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We noted that whilst during this Quarter, André has done additional development work as well as the Summary Tool redesign, in Q2 his focus will shift purely to the tool redesign
  - [**effect**] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- AI workflow, Q1 - see https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/233 

We noted that Stephen was planning to look this month at approaches to auditing graph data - but this turned out to be a much bigger chunk of work than would fit into this budget line, so it has become a proposal in the BGI Nexus funding round  https://deepfunding.ai/proposal/ethical-ai-auditing-a-practice-based-approach/ 

Instead, in this issue, he will be focusing on building infrastructure tools.
  - [**effect**] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- LLM development (see https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/244 (Feb) and https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/252 (March)
Stephen has built a GitHub App Token Generator - basic proof-of-concept, which uses GraphQL to interface with GitHub data via GitHub API.  In March, he will be looking at other data tools that might be useful in our work in Q2.
  - [**effect**] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- WG Sync call at the end of March - we decided to reiterate that meeting summaries will not be audited during Q2, and suggest a time limit to submit a summary, after which it will be recorded as "no summary given"

Suggestions ranged from a day to a Quarter - we settled on a month after the meeting took place.
  - [**rationale**] It shouldn't be turned into a competition; also, some WGs use meeting summary-writing as an onboarding task, so there needs to be time for support to be given and corrections to be made.
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- Research on not correcting meeting summaries in Q2: 

We noted that our planned approach might influence what kind of data we get in a meeting summary, and in the resultant knowledge graph. 

Hypothesis: we will get well-defined edges (i.e. connections between entities), because this often depends on simple structured data (who was present in a meeting, which meetings a given topic was discussed in, etc); but we might have less information about what anyone *said* when they discussed a topic, since people in the Ambassador program have historically been less good at documenting this kind of information.

Analysis of what kind of data we are getting with uncorrected summaries might later feed in to the design of the new summary tool - perhaps by attempting to design it to help people collect the kind of data that is missing, if any.

#### Action Items:
- [**action**] Vani has approached DeepFunding, to ask if the Events Circle could take on documentation of DF Town Hall. Focus Group agreed this would be valid - waiting for a reply

Also some interest in Focus Group re: how the Archives tool could be used for further documentation within DF [**assignee**] CallyFromAuron [**due**] 2 April 2025 [**status**] in progress
- [**action**] André has fixed the  issue with tags where people are copy-pasting strings of comma-separated tags into the summary tool, but they are not rendering as separate tags, but as strings.  [**assignee**] André [**due**] 5 March 2025 [**status**] done
- [**action**] André and Vani to meet to wrap up the tag taxonomy issue by deciding on an initial controlled vocab for topic and emotion tags [**assignee**] André, CallyFromAuron [**due**] 2 April 2025 [**status**] todo
- [**action**] Andre to add "All", "Alfred Itodele" and "Maxmilez" as new Names in the names controlled vocab [**assignee**] André [**due**] 19 March 2025 [**status**] todo

#### Keywords/tags:
- **topics covered:** graph database, Neo4j, summary tool, autosave, decision tracking, Robert Stalnaker, AI ethics, Ai recordkeeping ethics, graph data modelling, Python, JSON, Decentralisation, Decentralization, representing our culture in summaries, tag taxonomy, names taxonomy, controlled vocabularies, comma-separated tags, semantic similarity, recordkeeping ethics, archives ethics
- **emotions:** interesting, wide-ranging, well-attended, slightly combative
