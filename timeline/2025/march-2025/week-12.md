#### Narrative:
We looked at the consent form responses, noting that 14 WGs have no objections and have thus passed; and 7 WGs have at least one objection, and these will need to be discussed.

We also noted that we did not establish any kind of quorum for this consent round - so even though some WGs only garnered very few responses (for example, Knowleddge Base only had 4), they still pass.

We started with the objections to AI Sandbox/Think Tank; this took most of the meeting and was still inconclusive by the end.

Key discussion points included:

ADMIN COSTS vs DELIVERABLES / OUTPUTS
2 objectors and 2 abstainers all commented that AI Sandbox/Think Tank is spending too high a proportion of their budget on admin (nearly 4x as much as they spend on outputs). In the discussion, it was suggested that perhaps some budget elements had been mis-described as admin, when actually they *are* outputs/deliverables. The nature of this WG means that its sessions are not just procedural meetings, but actual learning sessions or debates, so in effect, it delivers a community event each week, so in a sense, its meetings *are* "outputs".

WHAT ARE PROJECT MANAGEMENT TASKS?
Tevo said that the project management tasks he does in his own WGs only take him minutes to do, so he queried why AI Sandbox/Think Tank is taking so much longer. He suggested the WG's quarterly report should list the fixed tasks needed to prepare each of its sessions - the WG has learnt, after operating for a few months, what these tasks are.

GITHUB vs DEWORK MANAGEMENT COSTS
Is the WG "double-dipping" by costing for both GitHub and Dework management? No. Project management for this WG (as for many other WGs) is done on a GitHub Board - but in order to process payments, the information still needs to be copy-pasted into Dework tasks, because the Treasury system unfortunately doesn't integrate directly with GitHub. But we noted that there may be questions over how long this should take, and that using Dework templates could make it faster.

PAYMENTS STOPPED IN Q1 2025
It was noted as background info that during Q1, Treasury stopped payments to Sandbox/Think Tank for certain project management tasks, because they felt it was not clear enough in the Dework task what was being done; and LordKizzy amended the Dework tasks to give more detail.

VALUE OF TOOL EXHIBITION SESSIONS
Tevo queried the value of the WG's tool exhibition sessions - do they give any more information about the tools than a person could gain by simply Googling? Are the selected tools actually useful? Should the sessions cover only sNET tools rather than just any AI tool? What is the impact of the sessions if nobody is actually using the tools under discussion? He acknowledged that perhaps the value is in the discussion itself, but still had questions, which were not fully resolved in this meeting.

PUBLIC GITHUB BOARD
Lord Kizzy screenshared the AI Sandbox/Think Tank GitHub board, and realised that as they're using 2 separate repos, one of them is not public. He agreed to make it all public, to improve transparency.

DOCUMENTING PLANNING SESSIONS AND ASYNC WORK 
There was a suggestion that the WG's planning meetings and async discussions need to be documented, for transparency. But it was noted that many WGs do this kind of work and don't document it publicly, and have not been asked to; so it is important to ensure we are not demanding something of AI Sandbox/Think Tank that is not being asked of other WGs.  We noted that in future Quarters, it could be made an absolute requirement for WGs to fully document this type of work, but it currently is not.

FLAT RATES FOR ADMIN COSTS?
It was suggested that all WGs should pay the same for admin costs such as facilitation, documentation, etc. The counter-argument was that in line with WG autonomy, WGs should continue to be able to make their own decisions on this, within reason, and that some variation is OK; particularly because the tasks are not exactly the same from WG to WG. There was no final decision on this.

TO RESOLVE OBJECTIONS TO AI SANDBOX/THINK-TANK
To resolve his objections, Tevo said that AI Sandbox/Think Tank need to:
- 1) update their budget sheet to remove as many things as possible from project management and assign to either of the deliverables (AI Sandbox sessions or AI Think Tank session);
- 2) if possible, lower the rewards for Dework task management, because it should use a template which they copy paste, and the work should not be more than 30 mins per week
- 3) make their GitHub board fully public so we can see all the tasks
- 4) explain in more detail, in the relevant GitHub issues, what the operational calls and async planning consist of, ideally including relevant links.



#### Discussion Points:
- Noting which WGs' Q2 2025 budgets have passed, and which have objections
- Working through the objections for AI Sandbox/Think Tank

#### Decision Items:
- We agreed that the following 14 WGs' budget have passed:

AI Ethics 
Archives
Gamers
GitHub PBL
Governance
Knowledge Base
LatAm
Moderators
Onboarding
Process
Strategy
Treasury
Treasury Automation
Video
  - [**rationale**] Because they had no objections
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We noted that the following 7 WGs' budgets have NOT passed, and need to be further discussed:

African
AI Sandbox/Think Tank
Education
Marketing
R&D
Translation
Writers
  - [**rationale**] Because they have at least 1 objection
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We agreed that next meeting, rather than continuing where we left off in the discussion on AI Sandbox/Think-Tank, we will start by reading through all the objections to all WGs, before beginning to discuss any of them.
  - [**rationale**] To ensure that we at least make people aware of what all of the objections are, even if we do not get time to address them all in one meeting. In this meeting, we focused in too quickly on one WG, and that took up all of the time.
  - [**effect**] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- We agreed that we will need to adjust the schedule for Governance meetings to allow for several more sessions on discussing the budget objections.
  - [**rationale**] because sorting out budget objections properly is more important than getting the budgets agreed quickly.
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We noted that we did not establish any kind of quorum for this consent round - so even though some WGs only garnered very few responses (for example, Knowleddge Base only had 4), they still pass.
  - [**rationale**] We have previously discussed the idea of a quorum, but never actually implemented one for this round.
  - [**opposing**] Possibly this is something to consider for next Quarter
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople

#### Action Items:
- [**action**] Everyone - particularly WGs with objections - will add comments in the "Responses" Googlesheet to address the objection(s), in time for the next meeting (Thurs 20th March). [**assignee**] all [**due**] 20 March 2025 [**status**] todo
- [**action**] Peter will give a brief update at today's Town Hall to outline where the budget consent process is at - and then we will endeavour NOT to talk about budget issues beyond that, to avoid exhausting people on the topic ("budget discussion burnout") [**assignee**] PeterE [**due**] 18 March 2025 [**status**] todo
