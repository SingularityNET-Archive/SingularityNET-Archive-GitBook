#### Narrative:
We started by going through tasks “in progress” on Github;
- We gave a quick nudge to people still on meeting documentation tasks from last quarter. We might have to record the 3rd February meeting notes as “no summary” if it's not there on the summary tool(Vani will check this out).
 
- Learnings from Q3 & Q4 Interviews: Vani will use insights from this session to improve our training materials and get it ready by our next meeting in June.

- WG Sync Calls: We will raise a discussion on payments in advance for tasks yet to be done at the call today.

- Transcription tasks: We have asked that people assigned get started on their respective interviews transcription if they haven’t done so now that the token price is looking good, and give updates on their GitHub issues. One thing we have learned here is that we should have asked people to have them done even when the token price was down so that they could get paid whenever token price looks good because now we are going to have make use of that faith we did not have and hope that the token price doesn't crash down while people are getting transcriptions done.
In the long run, we should try normalizing anonymised interviews to ease our workflow when we transcribe them from the recordings.

- Q2 2025 Budget update: Price is up, and anything that has to do with research and data collection is our priority; what do we do? Aside from paying for Q1 transcription tasks(all 15 of them), should we revert to our original budget for admin roles? And should we pay for any of the admin tasks now? Colleen suggested that we revert to the original budget of 0.30 for admin roles in addition to extra interviews; Vani pointed out that we are slightly over the budget overall and that if we pay out most things as it is now, then we won't have anything extra if the token gets back quite high. 
Love was of the opinion that we do not top up the admin roles and instead use this chance to clear up at least half of the carried-over payment(specifically the co-chair role) from last quarter that is just sitting there before doing more interviews if possible and the rest of it.
Vani agreed that keeping things for too long in the background is bad practice but that she would prefer we use that money we want to subsidize for the co-chair role payment from last quarter for more interviews instead. She also said that everything depends on token price in the next few weeks and our priority is still getting transcription tasks paid and the editing/checking of course and that once we are done paying for the ones on the board currently then we can think about what to do about the carried-over payment. She also suggested that the admins go back and discuss more on this and come up with a final solution.
Peter pointed out that we should keep in mind that the co-chair role payment we are talking about was budgeted in Q1 2025 with a token price of 0.50. It is still an issue.

- More Interviews: We asked people who are up for possible interviews depending on token price and budget to signify and we got a good number including people who didn't do interviews last time. We had PG, Grandi, Clement, Maximilez…etc. We are trying to get prepared.

- AOB
Colleen announced an event(community discussion) coming up next week(19th May at 14:00 UTC) where she will be representing us at, and invited us all to attend. The topic is AI Ethics and the ethics of achieving AI emotions and giving ASI emotions.

#### Narrative:
BUDGET RETHINK DECISION 

We discussed rethinking the budget cap, with Vani sharing a draft spreadsheet to capture each workgroup’s bare minimum needs—just a starting point, not final figures. She emphasized the challenge of defining what's truly essential and warned against over-reporting. The goal is to understand who needs more and why, while being fair to all. We all agreed and suggested that we ask teams to show how their current cap compares to their minimum needs. To deal with token price swings, we proposed using a fixed AGI reference price or listing needs in USD for clarity. Vani will adjust the spreadsheet and is welcoming feedback.


BUDGET ALLOCATION AND PRIORITIZATION DISCUSSION

Guillermo shared that LATAM teams have been making do without asking for more, though they could really use twice as much. He questioned whether extra funding should come with clear expectations or outcomes. Vani agreed there’s need for limits, noting that more money for one team might mean less for another. She suggested adding a column in the budget spreadsheet to indicate where extra funds should come from—though she admitted that could cause tension. She also referenced Peter’s point that in the chats that being resourceful shouldn't be penalized. Ultimately, she said the group needs to figure out how to evaluate which requests are truly necessary, even if the process is uncomfortable.


BUDGET REDUCTIONS AND WORKGROUP ALLOCATION 

Peter shared some tough news: due to the Phase Two token model, overall funding is dropping—about 1.241 million tokens for the year, which could mean up to a 30% cut from last quarter.
Vani suggested two ways to handle it: either a flat cut for all teams or a proportional one that protects lower-funded groups. She leaned toward the flat cut for simplicity, allowing teams to request more if needed.
Peter mentioned using reserves to soften the impact, but the group pushed back—reserves should be for special cases, not to cover regular gaps. Guillermo agreed, supporting a balanced, fair approach.
In the end, we agreed to apply an equal percentage cut to all budget caps in the spreadsheet, with room for teams to adjust or ask for more if necessary.


BUDGET ALLOCATION DISCUSSION  

Vani suggested a shift in how the group approaches budgeting. Instead of focusing strictly on financial totals—like how much each group needs or has—it might be more useful to look at the activities each team is planning and what their “bare minimum” requirements are. She emphasized the need for group input and consensus, rather than making top-down decisions. She then asked if we should distribute the budget loss evenly across all workgroups, percentage-wise? She proposed that this even distribution would serve as the budget cap for the next quarter. Guillermo reminded everyone that the next quarter starts in about two weeks, so decisions need to happen quickly.
Vani volunteered to put the spreadsheet plan out by the end of the day and asked whether people could respond quickly.


FUNDING AND UPCOMING MEETINGS

We discussed cleaning up the budget spreadsheet—Vani suggested simplifying totals and rounding numbers for clarity. The meeting felt a bit stuck since progress depends on input from other teams. We used the time to plan for Thursday’s big discussion, agreeing it needs structure to avoid turning into a chaotic defense of individual projects. We’ll raise awareness through the town hall and channel reminders, even if it feels repetitive.
There was tension around recent token cuts—Vani voiced concern, especially for the ambassador program, while Peter explained it was a broader, community-backed decision to stretch resources. Looking ahead, we agreed Thursday’s meeting won’t be useful without full team input. Vani offered to follow up and suggested adding a column to the spreadsheet to ask if more cuts are possible. Peter noted some teams, like Knowledge Base, aren’t requesting more, which may help balance things.
We plan to tweak and share the spreadsheet by day’s end and bring it to the town hall. Vani’s unsure how Thursday will go—but expects strong turnout: “people always show up when it’s about money.” Maxmilez kindly offered to handle the meeting summary of our next (Open GovWG) meeting happening this Thursday - 15th May.

#### Narrative:
Narrative:
During the meeting we discussed several important topics: Budget submission deadlines for workgroups because only six out of twenty-one groups submitted their information as it is. We need inputs from other WG to complete the form to enable the Q3 Budget progress to its final stage.   A key arouse around What should be the new deadline for workgroups to submit their budget information, in order to have others complete their form there will be need for a deadline to be announced on WGs that are yet to complete the form.   After several discussions there was an agreed date set for the Deadline which is on Tuesday 2oth May at 14UTC and any WG that failed to do so, we will assume they are okay with their current Budget cap for Q3.

Token minting and its impact on budget allocations: Furthermore there was a brief breakdown on the adjustment of the AGIX token minting plan which was carried out by Peter Concerning  the whole proposal here is. He pointed out that  back in 2021, there was a plan to increase the circulating supply of AGIX tokens with 100%. So it used to be 1 billion and this proposal turned it into 2 billion. And the very first edition of this proposal included minting these tokens over five years total. And this was changed by community suggestion, by Jan Horlinks actually, to shift it over to 91 years in total. He went further to explain that there is a slow decline in minting over 91 years rather than a total halt in 2026. He pointed out that from the beginning of minting in 2021, the price of tokens has risen dramatically, offsetting the decline in the number of tokens produced. He added that a recent vote had approved giving the foundation 100 million tokens to be used for hardware acquisitions. With this piece of information a lot of members in this meeting understood the reason behind the budget cap and the reductions of 1.5% for every quarter.


Consent Process and Q3 Dates Discussion: (i.e. to check in the room on whether everybody thinks Tuesday is okay as a deadline)?
After a closer look on what we have covered in this meeting, We all consent to the date which is Tuesday to be a meeting with the agenda of Discussing the Consent Process and Q3 Dates.

Participation and engagement in budget discussions: According to the the last run of the Anonymity consent process which was found not chaotic, a suggestion was raised regarding the upcoming Anonymity to have a survey to see if there are others will like to share their opinion on some of the budget proposals but doubt if they will if it’s not going to be Anonymous they might just decide not to share. While others suggest going back to the old ways with a point of others using the Anonymity process to consent multiple times without anyone knowing. Someone raised a suggestion in the past of putting on something  like the Swarm account or some other account and then appoint one person who can see to it and that person is also not dependent on funding that at the end the column for members Discord name and email address will not be seen and having those that can verity.

While the others who is so there's only one person who can see it in that case it would be Tevo but you know we could create a whole new account just for this that only one person one trusted person can see it could be you Peter somebody who's kind of not dependent on funding is therefore not engaged and then when we share it we just delete the columns that give the person person's Discord name and email address, but we have those so that we can verify.


Structure and implications of the consent process: An issue was raised on WG whose members don’t show concern to consenting on their workgroup looking at the number of members but with little ratio when it comes to consenting and that having 60 Core contributors, what will be the Quorum for that. There was an agreement to this concerning using a Quorum in that way WG will have the responsibility to task members to approve their proposal. Someone added that in scenarios where WG members feel the whole proposal thing has been rushed by their leaders and they are not sure and feeling uneasy to speak up in the WG, they can say so by not consenting.
Discussion on Upcoming Consent Round and Participation Issues

There was an addition also in preparation for the upcoming consent round, the need for an anonymous feedback form and the potential for a session to guide participants on its use and someone will have to overlook and gather feedback on quorum and anonymity in a town hall or Discord to ensure clarity among participants due to low participation rates and expressed the need for asynchronous input options.

The meeting ended on a positive and lighthearted note, while we all expressed optimism about getting WG members to consent and introducing a Quorum or not.
