### African Guild

- **Type of meeting:** Weekly
- **Present:** Clement Umoh [**facilitator**], UKnowZork [**documenter**], Clement Umoh, advanceameyaw, UKnowZork, CJFrankie, Duke, Jeffrey Ndarake
- **Purpose:** Bi-weekly meeting of the African guild 
#### Narrative:
Intro: The call opened with Clement suggesting a shift from bi-weekly to monthly meetings, citing the current low token price and our budget limitations. He proposed that the idea be discussed further with the Focus Group before making a final decision.
CJFrankie supported the idea, suggesting that we hold meetings on the first Thursday of every month to help cut down on costs, especially given the unfavorable token rates. However, Advance expressed concerns about this change, emphasizing that bi-weekly meetings help maintain momentum and keep the workgroup effective. While he acknowledged that monthly meetings might ease the budget strain, he felt we should stick to the bi-weekly schedule if it's still feasible. 


Highlights / Upcoming events
Clement shared details about the upcoming Afro AI Multilingual Workshop in Nigeria, organized through the Education Initiative. This is the second phase of the workshop, and this time, the content will be translated into Hausa. Clement believes this approach will not only make the material more accessible but also encourage more people to learn the language. The workshop will spotlight African innovators and incorporate storytelling to foster deeper local engagement.
Advance asked concerning communication around brand guidelines for flyer design and marketing support for post scheduling. If needed, the marketing team will assist with flyer design upon Clement’s request, but he added that he will first check with Kizzy for clarity.


AOB: Advance asked about the next steps for the Research on Indigenous AI tools for Africans. Clement explained that while there were plans to continue, the Guild has put things on hold for now because of the current AGIX token price. They’re hoping to pick it back up once the price improves.


The meeting wrapped up with Clement promising to share the storyline documents used in the Afro AI Multilingual Workshop via the Discord channel.
