#### Narrative:
BUDGET REVIEW AND ASSESSMENT OF WORKGROUP NEEDS 
Vani shared the updated budget, which includes everyone’s original input plus a new column for each team’s "bare minimum" funding needs. Teams were grouped into three categories: no response (assumed okay) - Education guild, Strategy guild, Gamers guild and Education WG, satisfied with their cap, and those asking for more. We’re currently $3,300 over budget.
To address this, Vani suggested reviewing the teams asking for more to see if their "minimum" needs are truly essential. Tevo questioned what we mean by "need," suggesting some teams could scale back or reuse content to save money (suspend operations for a quarter or not do anything new).
Vani pushed back, warning that too many cutbacks could weaken the ambassador program, as we've seen before. Tevo clarified he wasn't suggesting a full stop, just smarter use of existing content. Others raised concerns about losing momentum if teams like video or writing pause their work.
We discussed whether the video team’s tasks like content creation and social media are areas to trim. Peter stressed not singling out any team but agreed we should assess where time and money are really going. We all agreed to go back to the different Workgroups and ask them to review their funding requests carefully and look for fair, practical cuts that won’t hurt the program’s impact or team morale.

VIDEO WORKGROUP BUDGET REQUEST: EVALUATION OVERVIEW 
The video team is operating with a tight budget, focusing only on short-form content (like Town Hall shorts) due to lack of funds. They’ve cut rewards, reduced editing rates, and still have unpaid work from last quarter, affecting this quarter’s budget.
There’s growing concern about whether some recurring tasks like shorts and Zealy engagement efforts are worth continuing. Some suggest prioritizing more creative content or cutting non-essential work. Vani urged all teams to reassess their budgets and identify what’s truly essential. Treasury guild might need extra support since it handles critical payments.
As time ran out, we discussed how to move forward: finalize minimum budgets first, then redistribute any extra. Some workgroups, like Archives, are already running with barebones setups but that may not be sustainable long term. Tough choices lie ahead.

BUDGET CONSIDERATIONS AND RESOURCE ALLOCATION / PRIORITIES  FOR WORKGROUP 
Tevo proposed a tiered budget approach: give each group $1,000 upfront to see what they can do, then offer more in a second round based on performance. Vani was skeptical, saying it would take too much time and coordination, especially with Q3 budgets due soon.
Peter noted that overhead costs seem stable now. Vani clarified that this isn’t about blaming anyone, but hard choices may be needed — like prioritizing content vs. governance. Some groups have asked for only small increases; others much more, raising the question of how to fairly redistribute funds.We talked on the deeper issue: what does the Ambassador Program actually value most? Governance, record-keeping, and decentralization were highlighted as core to its identity, not just optional extras.
Ideas like quantifying internal vs. external impact or running a survey to gauge group importance were floated, and it was done. Vani stressed the need for groups requesting more to clearly define their true minimum needs.
Lordkizzy asked if reserves could help. A lot of people  gave a clear “no” using reserves for recurring costs was already rejected in previous decisions. The goal is to make tough but sustainable budget calls now.
We agreed that some groups may need to cut or rethink operations, and Tevo made a point that those who need less budget shouldn’t be penalized. The focus moving forward is clarity, fairness, and smarter prioritization.

BUDGET MANAGEMENT AND WORKGROUP SUPPORT 
Tevo shared his frustration from last year’s budget cuts and proposed a new approach: allocate funds based on the collective sentiment of contributors, rather than strict numbers. Groups could choose to keep the funds, return some to reserves, or share with others. The idea was to make the budget allocation a collaborative, priority-driven process.
Vani appreciated the idea but raised concerns about people judging workgroups they’re not directly involved in, leading to biased or vague impressions. Tevo suggested this would be iterative, with future evaluations based on impact, creating a learning loop. Peter warned that underfunding could lead to groups collapsing, which could have a negative emotional and community impact. Maxmilez suggested a compromise: keep current caps but allow some extra funding if needed, possibly using unused reserves from other groups. Vani acknowledged this but raised the question of whether some groups, like Treasury, could function on just the caps. We wrapped up the meeting with a few options for next steps: meet again on Thursday, adopt Maxmilez’s proposal, ask groups what they could do with their caps, or explore Tevo’s sentiment-based model.

PLANNING, PRIORITIZATION & FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
We raised concerns about timing, noting that while gathering input is useful, it won’t solve the deeper, systemic issues this quarter. We also called for the need to have a broader conversation on work quality, priorities, and long-term sustainability. As an interim step, we suggested setting basic budget caps for now and continuing the discussion on the next Governance Call happening on Thursday.
Tevo agreed on collecting some quick input — even a simple graph or 10-minute survey could offer insights. Vani supported the idea but cautioned against relying on too small a sample. Peter emphasized the value of learning from mistakes, as long as outcomes are tracked and improvements follow. He suggested saving deeper governance talks for Thursday and Tevo volunteered to create a ranked choice voting tool or forum to help structure that discussion. It might be a bit much, he admitted, but it could help guide Thursday’s session.
The meeting wrapped up with Peter encouraging contributions to the upcoming Town Hall, especially from those with non-governance topics, and confirmed that our conversation would continue in the next Open Governance call happening next week Thursday.
