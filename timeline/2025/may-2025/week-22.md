#### Narrative:
Intro: The call opened with Ayo asking UknowZork how she’s been coping, especially since many of the guild meetings have now shifted to a Bi-weekly schedule. He also asked if she’s been getting or taking up tasks.
UknowZork shared that she’s been able to pick up small documentation tasks and is hopeful for more opportunities. Ayo encouraged her, noting that consistent participation and attending calls is the best approach. He asked if UknowZork attends AI Sandbox calls, as they’re a great space for learning and growth.
Ayo mentioned that the meeting would proceed as planned, though it might be shorter due to fewer attendees. He asked everyone to wait a couple of minutes while he prepared the updates. There was a light moment when Ayo joked about mixing up who’s based where, sharing how he recently visited Uyo and Calabar but wasn’t sure who from the team lived there.
Finally, Ayo said he would share the agenda on screen and suggested using the last meeting’s agenda summary as a base since no new notes had been posted yet.

Q2 Updates / Workshop / approach / Research & May TownHall Presentation
Ayo shared details about the survey form and shared that since there’s not much feedback, the team had decided to change their strategy. Instead of trying to get input during the guild meetings or workshops, like they had originally planned, they’re now shifting to a more direct approach. The plan is to reach out to people individually with specific questions, gather their responses, analyze the data, and then send back the results. He explained that the challenge right now is figuring out exactly who to contact in each guild. For example, in the African Guild, they need to identify three reliable members—people who still show up consistently for calls, even with the token price drop. This way, they can be sure they’ll get the responses they need.

Ayo also gave an update on the Q2 research, noting that it’s a continuation of the Q1 work. The Guild is partnering with Deep Funding and have already compiled a list of documents that he had previously shared with Deep Funding. The main challenge has been figuring out which guild circles to focus on. At first, it seemed like the research was for the IT circle, then it looked like the Review circle, then Data Analytics, and finally Operations. Since Ayo wasn’t able to attend the April meeting, he mentioned it might be a good idea to attend the May one for more clarity. He also pointed out that for the Q3 budget, it’s already known that the token price has dropped, and there will be cuts to the budget for each workgroup or guild. For instance, Strategy Guild is now set to receive $861, which is adjusted to 2,868 AGIX tokens at the current rate of $0.3 per AGIX. So, the budgets are definitely tighter. He expressed some uncertainty about the research project—whether it’s happening at all. With the end of May approaching and only a few weeks left in the quarter, time is running out. Clement added his thoughts, saying that this was the original vision—getting people who are active in the whole AI market space so they could collect more expansive data for fresh perspectives on the analysis. He also took a moment to appreciate the effort of the research team.

AOB: Jeffery asked about  the next steps for the research, reminding Ayo that he had mentioned including him as part of the research team, but he hadn’t heard anything since. Ayo apologized for the communication gap, admitting he hadn’t been very active on Discord lately and hadn’t seen any clear details about including him as part of the research team. After reviewing past conversations, he didn’t find much concrete information and suggested there might have been a misunderstanding or missing context. In a lighthearted moment, Ayo even joked that if he had said Jeffery was on the research team, he must have been “really drunk,” as Jeffery isn’t a core member of the Guild.

To smooth things over, Ayo reassured him that he would double-check the meeting details and do a follow up with him. Kateri also mentioned she had some pending messages that hadn’t been addressed yet. Ayo apologized again and promised to get back to her after the call.

The meeting wrapped up with Ayo encouraging both Kateri and Jeffery to reach out so they could clarify things and move forward together.

#### Discussion Points:
- Meeting started with Slate welcoming everybody
- Then the topic shifted to the Q3 Budget discussion, Slated noted that if we take the current token price rate now we'd be having $1200 as our budget and we still have allocations to some backlogs like Governance framework project - $1300 and an extra of $220 from Q3, Presentation (Kinechi) $70, Call and administration task $360 and Certification Program $1360.
- Then the discussions started in regards to Certification Program project. Slate noted that we are looking for a platform to showcase the certification Program & we allocated $222 to it.

- We also had a discussion on Deepfunding review role. Slate proposed to have it done in the guild. He noted that this could give credibility to a person and this could also increase one's reputation score in the guild.
