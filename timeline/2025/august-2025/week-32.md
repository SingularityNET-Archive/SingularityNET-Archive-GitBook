  - [GitHub Issue for this meeting](https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/275)

#### Decision Items:
- As token price remains low, we still won't submit any pending Q1 tasks at the moment; although we might rethink and pay anyway in September
  - [**rationale**] The Q1 budget was calculated at $0.55 so we're not there yet
  - [**opposing**] but we shouldn't leave tasks unpaid for too long, despite token price
  - [**effect**] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- On the monthly archives GitBook issues: summaries are still being submitted without any chasing, so the Archives are fairly complete for August; although as previouly noted, there are fewer meetings happening in general.

There is also a continuing pain point with finding time to do Town Hall summaries.
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- In July, Stephen and Vani's focus (see https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/274) has been on developing learning resources and community engagement around how to use Neo4.j Aura, and rule-based auditing of its outputs. However, we have begin to think about whether there could be a more open-source approach than relying on proprietary tooling such as Neo4j
  - [**rationale**] using proprietary colsed-source tooling is not in line with the ethos of the Archives project
- Q3 quarterly report and Q4 budget are likely to be due on 8th Sept September. Vani has started draft versions, and we will sign them off in the September meeting (Sept 3rd). 

We are likely to need to work with quite a low budget, and will need to take money from reserves to cover work on the summary tool redesign. We might have to choose whether to prioritise graph work or summary tool.


  - [**rationale**] because the agreed exchnage rate for Q4 may be even lower than $0.30, so we are unlikely to have money for anything beyond core activities.

#### Action Items:
- [**action**] A member of DF Events Circle, Abdulbasit, has taken on documentation of DF Town Hall - Vani gave a walkthru/training session and he's planning to start with the next TH meeting.
 [**assignee**] CallyFromAuron [**due**] 29 August 2025 [**status**] done
- [**action**] Stephen to post in the Archives Discord channel to say that our graph development repo has been moved to the sNET GitHub organization, and to encourage people to have a look

And he will attend the next Town Hall to say this and say a bit about what we are doing this Quarter. [**assignee**] Stephen [QADAO] [**due**] 15 July 2025 [**status**] done
- [**action**] Vani has contacted AI Sandbox/Think Tank, and yes, they will  host a workshop on our graph work towards the end of September - exact date to be confirmed [**assignee**] CallyFromAuron [**due**] 11 July 2025 [**status**] done
