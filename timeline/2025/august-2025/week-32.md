#### Narrative:
Task Review: "In Progress" tasks on the Github board were reviewed. 

Transcription tasks: these were all completed by the due date at the end of July

Co-Chair (Vani):  Vani has been reorganising the folder structure on the BGI Nexus drive where interview material and transcripts are stored. Esther and Vani are discussing whether to retain or delete the original (non-anonymised) recordings - likely they will be deleted to avoid accidentally sharing them. Once all this Quarter's interviews are done, Vani will be verifying interview validity and sending the tasks for payment.

WG Internal Management (Sucre n Spice): Sucre's work is progressing well for this Quarter; she has somewhat less to do than in previous Quarters due to lower token price, the Workgroup has fewer paid tasks that need processing. 

WG Async Work Support (Love): Work is going as planned; no blockers. 

Transcript checking (Vani): in progress; no blockers, although checking ranscripts is always quite slow work.

Interviews: Deadline for Q3 interviews is 8th August. If any interview is not done by then, tbe budget for it will either be reassigned to someone else, or returned to the pot. The assignees are Clement(2x), Grandi(2x), UknowZork(2x), Rems, and Jeffrey.
The validity criteria will be similar to previous quarters, but with a slight tweak to the thresholds for part-paying interviews that are too short.

Conferences & Events: Nothing concrete yet about any potential involvement in the BGI-25 conference in October 2025 in Istanbul. Vani will meet with Esther later this month to discuss. 

We discussed how to manage payments given the current low token price - see "Decisions" below.



#### Decision Items:
- AI Ethics MOOC Study Group: We decided not to proceed
  - [**rationale**] we realized that nobody currently has time to take part in a course so we agreed to revisit the idea in our September meeting.
  - [**effect**] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- The timing for task payments will be dependent on token price
  - [**rationale**] The WG will maintain its financial decision of no task payout during the Quarter if the token price is below the price at which the budget was calculated (Q3 2025 was calculated at 1 AGIX = $0.30)

If the token price stays below $0.30 for the whole Quarter, then at the end of the Quarter, priority fr payments will be given to "output-based" tasks done by members, rather than admin roles - so the admin team will "take the hit".

#### Action Items:
- [**action**] Vani to meet with Esther and Haley about the Workgroup's potential involvement in the BGI-25 conference in October [**assignee**] CallyFromAuron [**due**] 11 August 2025 [**status**] in progress

#### Keywords/tags:
- **topics covered:** AI Ethics MOOC Study group, Interview Transcription, Interviews, Budget Management , Events, BGI-25 conference, low token price
- **emotions:** Brief, Deliberative


## Wednesday 6th August 2025


### Archives Workgroup

- **Type of meeting:** Monthly
- **Present:** Stephen [QADAO] [**facilitator**], CallyFromAuron [**documenter**], CallyFromAuron, Stephen [QADAO], PeterE, Alfred Itodele, Tevo
- **Purpose:** Regular monthly meeting of the Archives WorkGroup in the SingularityNET Ambassador program
- **Meeting video:** [Link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4dGsCqdRj6ct6TwdrVKm_Bjg2ToCjzQh)
- **Working Docs:**
  - [Q3 2025 budget](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14IYxBj-9MGCZRkYIupwvbHgPYZgohnyMSQ-EUFBgpYI/edit?usp=sharing)
  - [GitHub Issue for this meeting](https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/275)

#### Decision Items:
- As token price remains low, we still won't submit any pending Q1 tasks at the moment; although we might rethink and pay anyway in September
  - [**rationale**] The Q1 budget was calculated at $0.55 so we're not there yet
  - [**opposing**] but we shouldn't leave tasks unpaid for too long, despite token price
  - [**effect**] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- On the monthly archives GitBook issues: summaries are still being submitted without any chasing, so the Archives are fairly complete for August; although as previouly noted, there are fewer meetings happening in general.

There is also a continuing pain point with finding time to do Town Hall summaries.
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- In July, Stephen and Vani's focus (see https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/274) has been on developing learning resources and community engagement around how to use Neo4.j Aura, and rule-based auditing of its outputs. However, we have begin to think about whether there could be a more open-source approach than relying on proprietary tooling such as Neo4j
  - [**rationale**] using proprietary colsed-source tooling is not in line with the ethos of the Archives project
- Q3 quarterly report and Q4 budget are likely to be due on 8th Sept September. Vani has started draft versions, and we will sign them off in the September meeting (Sept 3rd). 

We are likely to need to work with quite a low budget, and will need to take money from reserves to cover work on the summary tool redesign. We might have to choose whether to prioritise graph work or summary tool.


  - [**rationale**] because the agreed exchnage rate for Q4 may be even lower than $0.30, so we are unlikely to have money for anything beyond core activities.

#### Action Items:
- [**action**] A member of DF Events Circle, Abdulbasit, has taken on documentation of DF Town Hall - Vani gave a walkthru/training session and he's planning to start with the next TH meeting.
 [**assignee**] CallyFromAuron [**due**] 29 August 2025 [**status**] done
- [**action**] Stephen to post in the Archives Discord channel to say that our graph development repo has been moved to the sNET GitHub organization, and to encourage people to have a look

And he will attend the next Town Hall to say this and say a bit about what we are doing this Quarter. [**assignee**] Stephen [QADAO] [**due**] 15 July 2025 [**status**] done
- [**action**] Vani has contacted AI Sandbox/Think Tank, and yes, they will  host a workshop on our graph work towards the end of September - exact date to be confirmed [**assignee**] CallyFromAuron [**due**] 11 July 2025 [**status**] done

### Education Workgroup

- **Type of meeting:** Weekly
- **Present:** esewilliams [**facilitator**], UKnowZork [**documenter**], esewilliams, UKnowZork, Slate, Gorga Siagian, LordKizzy, Kateri, osmium, Alfred Itodele
- **Purpose:** Weekly meetings update
- **Working Docs:**

#### In this meeting we discussed:
- Content Creation Task - Project Focus, Assignments and Progress  - Low Attendance Concerns

#### Discussion Points:
- Ese opened the meeting by reviewing the discussion from the last session. She restated the key points and highlighted the action items. Gorga confirmed that all previously outlined action items had been completed.
- Ese then asked Slate if he had assigned roles for the content creation task. Slate responded that he had not done so yet. He suggested that content creators might require a separate group, but mentioned that Gorga had recommended they remain within the same group. He also added that the assessors would be responsible for assigning roles to content creators. When asked about ongoing projects, Slate confirmed that the CCCP program is currently the main focus.
- There was a brief discussion about the low meeting attendance. Ese asked if the shift to biweekly meetings was the cause. Slate noted that attendance may have dropped due to the change in administrative focus—many only attend meetings when they are directly involved in decision-making. Kateri agreed, adding that there’s also been confusion around meeting dates due to the biweekly schedule. She pointed out that this miscommunication is affecting the guild. Given the budget constraints, she suggested that perhaps meeting announcements should be made at least a week in advance. Gorga supported the idea.
- We talked about the project updates and Ese noted that the education series led by Ese, Gorga, and Kateri was in progress and the presentation series led by Kinechi was almost done while the governance series was led by LordKizzy. LordKizzy reported that he has created a slide for the presentation. The remaining part is for Vani to complete. Although there’s no strict deadline, the project is expected to be completed within the quarter. Slate asked whether Kizzy was developing presentation materials, and Kizzy confirmed that the slides focus on in-depth governance models. The series will consist of 8 sessions followed by a sprint in which participants answer questions based on previous governance sessions.
- Gorga shared a Web development presentation he presented in the Gamers Guild. He explained that the idea was to repurpose it into a web development glossary for the ambassador program. It would resemble a GitBook but would focus solely on education and onboarding content. Slate also added that he has built a Wiki website for DeepFunding and proposed that the Education Guild could adopt a similar approach. The wiki could house the glossary section and include a voting tool. He mentioned he would check with Guillermo about the possibility of integrating the skills database into the platform. Gorga asked if the CCCP program could also be integrated, and Slate responded that he could manage that, though he would take the lead on the development. Ese and the group supported Slate’s idea, noting that a centralized wiki platform would make the program appear more organized. She asked if it could be created at no cost, considering the guild’s limited budget. Slate replied that the wiki site itself could be created for free, but integrating the glossary might require some budget.
- The meeting concluded with Ese emphasizing the importance of follow-up and accountability for all individuals handling projects this quarter. She stressed that timely submissions are critical to ensuring that the guild meets its quarterly metrics and goals.

#### Action Items:
- [**action**] Slate will share a proposal for the Wiki website creation and the Wiki platform is expected to be revamped by next week. [**assignee**] Slate [**due**] 20 August 2025 [**status**] todo
- [**action**] A system of follow-up and accountability will be put in place to ensure timely completion of projects. [**status**] todo

#### In this meeting we discussed:
- Introduction and welcome:
The meeting began with a warm welcome, followed by Vasu leading a continuation of the previous agenda. The discussion focused on AI agent development, includimg the governance advisor agent *EthosGuard*, and introducing new roles such as an analytics agent.
- Treasury and Budget Automation Insights:
Vani and Guillermo discussed the automation of treasury and budgeting consent processes, emphasizing the importance of aligning budget formats and quarterly reports with the tools under development by Guillermo’s team. They pointed out the shift toward a more formalized budgeting process, and noted that an agent could be used to flag possible omissions in budget submissions to ensure completeness.
- Integration of Treasury Database and Core Contributor Criteria:
Guillermo highlighted the importance of integrating the treasury database with Archives WG's forthcoming knowledge graph to improve data visualization. Vasu proposed using an ASI1 LLM agent in the Governance dashboard to automate the onboarding process for core contributors.
- Data Integration and Contributor Metrics:
Vani and Vasu discussed merging data from sources like Dework and GitHub to identify core contributors. They also considered a leaderboard system, though Vani raised concerns about potential negative effects of fostering competitiveness among core contributors.
- AI Agent Integration and Ethical Considerations
Guillermo highlighted the capabilities of AI agents in GitHub analytics and proposed the creation of a character-driven assistant for governance discussions. Vani raised concerns about the reliability of AI suggestions, suggesting that they should be treated as prompts for critical thinking rather than authoritative recommendations. The conversation also touched on whether AI should/can be used to help track reflections over time in governance.
- AI-Human Collaboration in Decision-Making
Guillermo highlighted the AI proposal on the BGI-Nexus funding round, stressing that AI offers decision-making support through suggestions, while humans retain final authority. He emphasized the need for clear, specific queries to avoid generic AI responses.
- Ethics and Governance in Decentralized Communities:
Vasu stressed the importance of fairness and transparency, proposing sentiment analysis to track changes in community sentiment. Vani emphasized focusing on governance experiments over granular details. Both agreed on the value of educating the community with interactive tools.
