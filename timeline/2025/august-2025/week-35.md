# Week 35

## Tuesday 26th August 2025

### Governance Workgroup

- **Type of meeting:** Weekly
- **Present:** CallyFromAuron [**facilitator**], CallyFromAuron [**documenter**], CallyFromAuron, UKnowZork, guillermolucero, CollyPride, Maxmilez, Martin Heyam Bielecki, Alfred Itodele, AshleyDawn, Ayomi Shuga, Jeffrey Ndarake, LadyTempestt, Omolola Lawson, Sucre n Spice
- **Purpose:** Regular Weekly GovWG meeting
- **Working Docs:**

#### Narrative:
1) Q4 2025 exchange rate
This Quarter's rate of $0.30 may be too high - token price has been closer to 27–28 cents, so sticking with 30 cents would constantly leave everyone short; but dropping it lower might squeeze budgets too much. People shared their thoughts, with suggestions ranging from 25 to 30 cents. After some back and forth, the room settled on 28 cents as a fair middle ground that wouldn’t be too risky or too harsh on project funding.

2) Governance Dashboard
Guillermo confirmed it will be ready in time for the start of the consent process, so we confirmed that it will be used.

3) Consent process timeline
The original deadline for budget submissions was set for September 8th, but since the new governance dashboard still needs testing and orientation sessions, everyone agreed to push it back a week to September 15th. The extra time will give workgroups a chance to learn how to use the new system without rushing.

4) Additions to what should be included in budget and reports
In previous GovWG meetings this Quarter we have agreed several changes, which we confirmed. WGs should include
 - percentage breakdown of how much of their budget is admin costs vs how much is outputs (mandatory)
 - amount of unallocated reserves (mandatory)
- a "reflection" section in reports on what could have gone better (optional)
- a few lines about the purpose/aim of the WG (optional)
- some information about this quarter's outcomes, not just outputs (optional)

5) Context-setting documents
Colleen offered to take on updating these. Guillermo pointed out that much of the tracking would already be managed automatically by the dashboard. The group agreed it would still be helpful to have some guidance in place, but they emphasized not wanting the process to become too rigid.

6) Publicity
We assigned Guillermo to redraft the timeline and the "Take part in the consent process" graphic. Vani and Guillermo will both post them when the time comes.

7) New participant
A new voice, Martin, joined in. He introduced himself as someone with a background in AI, neuroscience, and research into attention and consciousness. His questions about the ethics of training AI with books sparked a short discussion, and the group warmly welcomed him and pointed him toward the AI Ethics and R&D workgroups where those discussions would continue.
