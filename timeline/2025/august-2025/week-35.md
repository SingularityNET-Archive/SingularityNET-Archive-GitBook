# Week 35

## Tuesday 26th August 2025

### Governance Workgroup

- **Type of meeting:** Weekly
- **Present:** CallyFromAuron [**facilitator**], CallyFromAuron [**documenter**], CallyFromAuron, UKnowZork, guillermolucero, CollyPride, Maxmilez, Martin Heyam Bielecki, Alfred Itodele, AshleyDawn, Ayomi Shuga, Jeffrey Ndarake, LadyTempestt, Omolola Lawson, Sucre n Spice
- **Purpose:** Regular Weekly GovWG meeting
- **Working Docs:**

#### Narrative:
1) Q4 2025 exchange rate
This Quarter's rate of $0.30 may be too high - token price has been closer to 27–28 cents, so sticking with 30 cents would constantly leave everyone short; but dropping it lower might squeeze budgets too much. People shared their thoughts, with suggestions ranging from 25 to 30 cents. After some back and forth, the room settled on 28 cents as a fair middle ground that wouldn’t be too risky or too harsh on project funding.

2) Governance Dashboard
Guillermo confirmed it will be ready in time for the start of the consent process, so we confirmed that it will be used.

3) Consent process timeline
The original deadline for budget submissions was set for September 8th, but since the new governance dashboard still needs testing and orientation sessions, everyone agreed to push it back a week to September 15th. The extra time will give workgroups a chance to learn how to use the new system without rushing.

4) Additions to what should be included in budget and reports
In previous GovWG meetings this Quarter we have agreed several changes, which we confirmed. WGs should include
 - percentage breakdown of how much of their budget is admin costs vs how much is outputs (mandatory)
 - amount of unallocated reserves (mandatory)
- a "reflection" section in reports on what could have gone better (optional)
- a few lines about the purpose/aim of the WG (optional)
- some information about this quarter's outcomes, not just outputs (optional)

5) Context-setting documents
Colleen offered to take on updating these. Guillermo pointed out that much of the tracking would already be managed automatically by the dashboard. The group agreed it would still be helpful to have some guidance in place, but they emphasized not wanting the process to become too rigid.

6) Publicity
We assigned Guillermo to redraft the timeline and the "Take part in the consent process" graphic. Vani and Guillermo will both post them when the time comes.

7) New participant
A new voice, Martin, joined in. He introduced himself as someone with a background in AI, neuroscience, and research into attention and consciousness. His questions about the ethics of training AI with books sparked a short discussion, and the group warmly welcomed him and pointed him toward the AI Ethics and R&D workgroups where those discussions would continue.

- Enhancing Human capabilities with AI
Colleen presented on the future of intelligence, focusing on ethical alignment and the importance of understanding AI decision-making. She noted that intelligence is evolving to encompass collaboration with AI as a new paradigm. Lordkizzy praised Colleen's presentation and encouraged questions.

- Ethical considerations in AI explainability:
Vani raised concerns about the ethical issue of explainability in AI, arguing that users should not have to trust AI blindly, and that its processes need to be transparent. Colleen and Heyam contributed to the discussion by acknowledging the complexities involved in making AI's reasoning clear and the dualistic nature of AI's impact on society. They emphasized the necessity of striving for positive outcomes in AI development.

#### Discussion Points:
- Updates and Introductions: Lordkizzy opened the Marketing Guild call by welcoming attendees and sharing the agenda for discussion. The group reviewed action items from the previous meeting.
- Martin Bielecki raised concerns about the marketplace’s historical associations and the interaction of personal AI models. Lord Kizzy clarified that the guild's focus is on brand awareness within the ecosystem, not marketplace details. Bielecki agreed on the relevance of AI interactions but was told it was beyond the discussion's current scope.
- Update on Scavenger Hunts:
Advanceameyaw reported on last week's engagement challenge designed to boost activity on Medium and YouTube channel. Participation was lower than anticipated, with only nine participants. Feedback will be gathered to refine future challenges, as the initial results fell short of expectations. Gorga provided an update on the graphics for the scavenger hunt, indicating that he would create a leaderboard graphic. Ese Williams raised concerns about the initiative's complexity, advocating for a more streamlined approach to improve effectiveness. She recommended exploring alternative methods if current tools prove ineffective.
- Declining Podcast Attendance and the Need for Accountability:
Lordkizzy raised concerns about declining podcast attendance. He noted that in Q1 and Q2, strict attendance rules helped maintain good participation, but attendance has since dropped, and it's now hard to get people to present — which is critical to their work. While he doesn't want to make any final decisions yet, he emphasized the need to monitor the situation. Since everyone is aware of the issue now, any future actions should not be seen as targeting anyone.
- Lord Kizzy presented two reward systems for extra activities, responding to concerns about unpaid rewards last month. He stressed the need to choose a system to ensure timely payments and suggested testing both options. The team also discussed a 20% cut to the Q4 marketing budget, emphasizing the need for strategic adjustments. The meeting ended with agreement on categorizing extra activities under tier one and discussed the token values, leading to a consensus on the distribution plan.

#### Decision Items:
- it was decided in the meeting to use tier 1 payment structure to pay extra activities

## Saturday 30th August 2025

### Gamers Guild

- **Type of meeting:** Monthly
- **Present:** Slate [**facilitator**], devon [**documenter**], LordKizzy, rebel, osmium, Gorga Siagian, PaulTiffany, martinsoki, Slate
- **Purpose:** Collaborative planning and technical walkthrough of the gamified ambassador portal, debugging animation issues, advancing comic initiative, and aligning workgroup updates.
- **Working Docs:**

#### Discussion Points:
- Gamified Portal Demo and Technical Overview

Slate opened the session by demonstrating the working prototype of the Gamified Ambassador Portal. The portal includes a login system, user XP tracking, guild-specific quests, and an admin panel. It is currently built on a Next.js frontend and uses Google Sheets as a backend. However, due to Google quota limitations, there was a discussion about shifting the backend to a proper database (possibly Supabase or Firebase). The design takes inspiration from Zilly and aims to create an immersive dashboard for contributors, while also enabling automation of XP systems and portal functionality.
- AI-Generated Comic Initiative

Initiative to develop AI-generated comics that explain SingularityNET’s projects and tools was discussed. Slate, Kizzy, and Osmium discussed using characters like Desdemona and Sophia to narrate stories in comic format. Tools like MidJourney for visuals, Google's AI animator, Hexfield, and Banana Model were suggested. These comics could be used to educate users in an entertaining way. The group agreed this could be a candidate for the DeepFunding Round 5 RFP ideation track, and Osmium offered to create a workflow demo to illustrate the comic creation pipeline.
- Writers Workgroup Animation Debugging

Lord kizzy mentioned the malfunctioning NPC animations in the Writers Workgroup department of the Roblox world. New animations prepared for characters like Devon were not playing correctly, even after republishing. It was concluded that the problem might be due to improper asset linking or format inconsistencies. To resolve this, the team agreed to test and reuse working animations from the Video Workgroup. Kizzy was tasked with copying and testing these working animation assets.
- Visual Enhancements to R&D Guild Areas

Rebel showcased improvements to the R&D Workgroup's rooms, including updated visuals for the Social Media Automation Tool (also correcting its name) and a more informative Governance Dashboard. The Governance section now includes a dynamic token price chart and upcoming AGIX votes UI, increasing interactivity and educational value. There were further plans to display token usage and past voting history within the portal. These upgrades aim to make the Roblox space not just visually appealing but also functionally informative.
- Team Expansion and Mentorship

The group discussed onboarding new memebers and assigning clear mentorship tasks. Slate committed to sharing a list of outstanding dev tasks and requirements to aid recruitment. Kizzy proposed bringing on a new member who showed promise in prior testing.
