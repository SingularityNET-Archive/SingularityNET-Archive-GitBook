#### Discussion Points:
- LordKizzy started the meeting greeting everyone 
- Zalfred gave an update for the presentation series, noting that he has completed his module, #4. There will be seven modules in total.
- Updates from Governance Workshop series, Kizzy notified that his the slides are complete and they will have a call to schedule the timeline and structure the assignment on the series to publicize it before hand.
- Certification program: Slate noted that it is the task of the accessor to assign the project selection to the content creator, so they will be able to create the material to be used. He also noted that they are five project which consist of five infographics and video, tho only four content creators were selected but it is up to the accessor to balance that.
- Slate revisited a project idea originally presented in the Gamers Guild but suggested it could also be a collaboration with the Education Guild. The project is an Ambassador Program glossary that explains keywords used in the program, ideally presented with animated characters and visuals rather than just text. He also discussed revamping an old wiki website and suggested using it to host the glossary.
- LordKizzy emphasized preparing for the next concern round, and asked if anyone was assigned to write the quarterly report, and  create the budgets. Slate highlighted the need to align on which projects to pursue before finalizing the budget sheet.
- Vasu proposed exploring a new project connected to the ASI Academy. The discussion included whether this initiative should be funded internally or externally, with a suggestion of creating a documentary-style presentation to strengthen the proposal. However, there was caution about avoiding overlap or duplication with similar initiatives.
- The meeting ended with the agreement that we are going to determine the budget sheet in the next meeting together
