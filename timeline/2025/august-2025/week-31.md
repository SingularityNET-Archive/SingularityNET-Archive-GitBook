#### Discussion Points:
- Slate presented a live demo of the JamGalaxy AI Synthesizer, explaining how the team overcame Roblox API restrictions by saving generated music files in Google Drive and then accessing them in-game. The demo included gameplay that allowed players to interact with and be scored on their generated music, while also displaying JamGalaxy’s branding and linking to the SingularityNET Marketplace. This was shared as a model of how third-party services can be embedded into Guild experiences.
- The AI Comics proposal, introduced by Slate, focused on creating visual story-driven comics to explain complex SNET concepts such as reputation systems, decentralized identity, or governance in an engaging way. Osmium contributed ideas based on past collaboration with Mindplex, emphasizing the potential of AI comic tools and referring to “Desdemona’s Dream” as a successful example of narrative-rich, visually appealing work. The group debated different tools like Canva versus custom animation or illustration styles and agreed that a prototype would strengthen a future RFP submission.
- In discussing the Gamified Portal, Slate shared a functioning prototype created using Google App Script, showing how tools and quests could be linked to XP systems and user progress. Kizzy raised concerns about email-based login due to privacy issues and recommended using Discord authentication instead. Osmium offered gamified UI templates and encouraged a shift to React or other modern platforms. Members supported using the system not only for tool promotion but also for educational training.
- The third idea was the Visual Glossary, an educational tool similar to W3Schools, where users could interactively explore terms and concepts related to the Ambassador Program. Slate explained that this glossary would include visual demonstrations for each term and potentially interactive simulations. However, Kizzy and Osmium expressed that this initiative might be better aligned with the Onboarding or R&D Guilds due to its educational nature. A debate emerged on whether the glossary could be considered truly “gamified,” and while Slate defended its interactive and visual elements as qualifying, Osmimum felt it lacked the core game mechanics like scoring or progression. Ultimately, it was agreed that this project could originate from Gamers Guild but should be executed in collaboration with R&D, AI sandbox, or Onboarding WG to ensure proper alignment and access to technical resources.
- Rebel showed recent work on the R&D Guild department in-game, including new logos and UI elements. However, issues remained with unanchored models, a non-functional narrator tool, and confusion over the intended purpose of the "social media" room. Kizzy clarified that what was labeled as a “social media room” was actually meant to showcase a social media automation tool, not social platforms themselves, and suggested correcting the naming. There was also a recommendation to replace the “Entity Connection” room with content from the Governance Dashboard.
- Slate confirmed that asset creation was open again and requested that Kizzy and others mentor new members. They will be assigned departments and guided through tasks like animation. The team discussed available departments (e.g., Sandbox, Regional Communities) for upcoming map development and agreed to form a dedicated mentorship group to support new contributors effectively.
- There was discussion about returning to biweekly meetings instead of monthly ones. Rebel noted that monthly cycles slowed momentum and delayed progress updates. Everyone agreed that biweekly meetings would help maintain a better rhythm and ensure faster iteration across projects.

#### Decision Items:
- The Guild agreed to restart asset creation for August.
- The meetings will shift back to biweekly
  - [**rationale**] to ensure more consistent feedback and to accelerate project development.
