  - [WG Syncing call, rolling agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Mdxr2DT9LOi_-7ZS7oIC69ilY67oGqReVhvOuNwUgYQ/edit?usp=sharing)

#### Agenda Items:
- Changes to consent process timeline - specifically, one round of consent instead of two - to conform with the features of the new Governance dashboard
- Integration of historical data into the Governance dashboard
- Verifying the validity of objections 
- Use of the 80-20 rule in the new single-round consent process
- Definition of consent decisionmaking

#### Discussion:
1) Change to consent process timeline

The new dashboard's commenting feature encourages people to comment on budgets and reports, and allows WGs to amend them in response. So the consent process cannot start until this process is finished, to prevent changes after consent is given.
To accommodate this, a new timeline with a single consent round was agreed: see "decisions" below.

We noted that this does not mean the second round is removed forever.


2)Integration of historical data into the Governance dashboard

It would be useful to add past objections and other historical data into the new dashboard, as recurring issues are revealing.
Migrating all data would be a significant effort. Could start with the most recent (Q2/3) data 
Could allocate a budget from Ambassador reserves for the task.
To be discussed further in a future meeting.


3) Verifying the validity of objections

The proposed timeline includes a focus group to check if objections are valid before they are discussed in the Governance WG meeting.
Alfred raised concerns about a small, unelected group making decisions and suggested representation from all workgroups to ensure fairness. But it was pointed out to him that the validity check does *not* involve "making decisions", but simply scanning for any potential invalidities, and the assessment is ratified or not in the Governance meeting.
We agreed to make the validity check an open session where anyone can participate, rather than a pre-selected focus group.
It was clarified that the role of this session is simply to check if an objection is valid, not to comment on how the objection should be resolved.


4) 80-20% rule

In past consent rounds, this rule has been applied in the 2nd round, so that a single objection cannot hold up the process indefinitely.
As we no longer have a 2nd round, the rule might be inapproriate, as it would silence minority objections before they could be discussed.
We agreed all objections will be discussed; and the 80/20 rule will only be applied if agreement cannot otherwise be reached.



5) Definition of consent decisionmaking

In response to a question from Ayomi, the consent process was explained.  
- Consenting to a budget does not mean that you think it is perfect; just that it is "safe enough to try". 
- Objections should not be the objewctor's own ideas for how things could be done better - an objection must identify actual, specific harm that would be caused if a proposal was carried out. 
- The process then focuses on resolving objections by asking objectors what would need to change in order to get their consent.



#### Decision Items:
- The group will adopt a single consent round for the Q4 budget process 
The budget approval timeline was revised and finalized as follows:
- Weds 17th Sept, 23:59 UTC: Deadline for WGs to submit reports and budgets.
- Mon 22nd Sept: End of commenting period; budgets are locked; consent process opens.
- Weds 24th Sept: Deadline for Core Contributors to consent/object/abstain.
- Thurs 25th Sept before Governance meeting: objection validity check session,
- Thurs 25th Sept: Discussion in Governance WG
- Tues 30th Sept: Discussion in Governance WG 

  - [**rationale**] To test the new dashboard's commenting functionality and see if it is able to speed up the consent process.
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- The meeting on Thurs 25th Sept to review objection validity will be an open session, and anyone who attends can participate.

It isn't a decision-making session - any "invalid" flags will be ratified in the Governance call.

  - [**rationale**] Inclusion and transparency.
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- The 80/20 rule will not be automatically applied.
All valid objections will be discussed, even if raised by only one person; and the 80/20 rule will only be applied if agreement cannot otherwise be reached.
  - [**rationale**] To avoid silencing minority objections
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
