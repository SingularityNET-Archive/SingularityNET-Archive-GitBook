## Thursday 25th September 2025


### African Guild

- **Type of meeting:** Biweekly
- **Present:** Clement Umoh [**facilitator**], martinsoki [**documenter**], UKnowZork, Sucre n Spice, Kateri, Duke, martinsoki, esewilliams, Udoma, Jedidiah Omotayo, Isaac Daniel, Iphone
- **Purpose:** African Guild Meeting, 25th of September, 2025
- **Working Docs:**

#### Narrative:
The meeting opened with Clement welcoming everyone to our last meeting for this quarter. The meeting began with a recap of the previous session, which focused on digital financial assets and traditional banking experiences in Africa. The group discussed the Q4 2025 budget, which totals $1,900, with $600 allocated to recurring tasks and the remainder split between projects and workshops. They outlined various initiatives for the quarter, including the Lean Guild Challenge, Talking Drone Dispatch, and plans for Twitter spaces and village meetings. SucrenSpice mentioned creating an alternative budget based on a lower AJX price to account for recent fluctuations.

The team introduced a new quarterly initiative: a bi-weekly newsletter titled "Talking Drum Dispatch," designed to engage the community using Afrocentric naming and themes. Duke explained that the newsletter would be sent to the existing email database to help convert leads into warm or hot prospects for future events and funding opportunities. The team also addressed concerns about declining meeting attendance—Duke noted that while past events attracted up to 80 participants, recent turnout has been lower.

Duke emphasized the need for renewed marketing and lead nurturing through the Talking Drum Dispatch, targeting contacts from the past year with updates on TestNet, TestNet Africa, and AI in Africa. He also outlined plans for Afro AI storytelling videos and shorts, initially conceived as part of the Green Guild Challenge. SucrenSpice and Clement assisted in retrieving relevant details from the meeting transcript to support planning.

Duke announced the launch of the Lean Guild Challenge, a new competition aimed at promoting SingularityNet, AI, AGI, and Africa through creative ideas and potential video content. While the exact competition format is still being developed, Duke suggested possible collaboration with the video workgroup and promotion via the Marketing Guild and Ambassador Program’s YouTube channel. He also highlighted plans to revive X Spaces and support small, low-budget events, encouraging participants to focus on generating tangible outputs in the final two months of the quarter.

The team began planning a smaller-scale Lean creative competition with a modest $100 budget, modeled after a previous initiative. They agreed to form a focus group to structure the competition and generate ideas. Love volunteered to create a brief submission form for participants who prefer not to join live discussions. The competition will be open to both guild members and non-members, with plans to award prizes to the top three submissions—rather than just one winner—to boost participation and motivation.

The team discussed cross-guild content collaboration, agreeing to assign a delegation to engage with LATAM counterparts for Q1 2026 planning. They prioritized the first five items on their action list and began brainstorming topics for an upcoming African youth meeting. Duke suggested a topic on how AI could predict the rapture, which Love expressed interest in.

#### In this meeting we discussed:
- This meeting is in collaboration with Archives WG - a presentation from Stephen Whitenstall of Archives WG about the work they have been doing on developing knowledge graphs using Archives / meeting summary data.

- Development of draph data from JSON:

Stephen presented on converting JSON data into graph data.
He outlined the meaning of some basic graph terminology: nodes (entities) and edges (relationships). He explained how conversion to a graph format allows a more network-like representation of data, which enables a different type of analysis. He has written using Python scripts to extract and manipulate data from the Archives' SQL database.
- Graph analysis and community detection in workgroup data:

Stephen discussed the analysis of a directed graph with about 1,800 nodes and 3,500 edges, and the identification of clusters and communities within the data. He used algorithms such as the Fuchter-Rheingold layout and Force Atlas 2 to visualize connections and discern patterns. The analysis indicated approximately 18 to 19 communities, which may represent various workgroups, and highlighted the potential for further statistical analysis to understand community influence and centrality.
- Ethical Considerations in AI Data Usage:
Stephen Whitenstall discussed the ethical implications of using community-owned data in AI projects, stressing the necessity of obtaining consent and maintaining an audit trail. Vasu Madaan mentioned plans to implement these principles using Cardano's blockchain technology. The focus is on ensuring that the community understands how their data is being utilized.
- Exploring Data Analysis and Community Engagement:
Stephen Whitenstall highlighted the goal of creating educational materials based on data analysis, suggesting that community input is crucial for understanding the significance of identified patterns. Vani emphasized the value of interactive sessions for deeper exploration of data insights, particularly regarding the influence of different work groups. They both acknowledged that the frequency of meetings does not necessarily equate to influence, as the weight of each meeting's impact varies.
- Discussion on Structured and Unstructured Data:
Stephen Whitenstall explained that the data being discussed is primarily structured, allowing for a fixed hierarchical approach. He acknowledged the presence of unstructured data, as pointed out by Vani, and suggested that a separate focus would be necessary for analyzing this type of data. He proposed using methods like vectorization and semantic analysis to extract insights from unstructured data.
- Generative Data and AI Ethical Standards:
Stephen Whitenstall highlighted the challenges of generative data, focusing on the necessity of grounding it to prevent misinterpretation. He advocated for applying AI ethical standards when developing tools like governance dashboards. Vasu Madaan mentioned the potential of using natural language data for analysis, although he noted delays in the high-prone approach. Both speakers acknowledged the importance of structured versus unstructured data in sentiment analysis.
- Data Structuring and Analysis in Governance Context
Stephen Whitenstall emphasized the need to interpret data semantically, particularly when dealing with structured and unstructured data in governance contexts. Vani raised concerns about the consent process, noting that while data fields appear structured, responses can often be unstructured and unclear. This discrepancy complicates the analysis and understanding of objections.

#### Action Items:
- [**action**] Create knowledge base graph for next AI agents civic framework discussion session with structured format and Continue AI agents civic framework topic discussion in next quarter (October) with enhanced preparation.  [**assignee**] osmium [**due**] 9 October 2025 [**status**] todo

## Saturday 27th September 2025

### Gamers Guild

- **Type of meeting:** Monthly
- **Present:** Slate [**facilitator**], devon [**documenter**], LordKizzy, Gorga Siagian, rebel, onfroy, Kateri, martinsoki, Slate
- **Purpose:** To review the Q4 2025 budget request breakdown, showcase prototypes (Visual Glossary and Gamified Portal), assign new map creators, and discuss Roblox publishing changes.
- **Working Docs:**

#### Discussion Points:
- Q4 2025 budget feedback & Visual Glossary Launch: 

Slate opened with feedback on our Q3 2025   report and Q4 2025 budget from the governance dashboard, noting a comment about the visual glossary's current disconnect from Ambassador Program terminology. He showcased the prototype of the Visual Glossary, explaining how it demonstrates terms like “XP System” and “Quest System” using animated visuals. The glossary is intended to educate users through interaction and UI animations.
- Visual Glossary Budget Breakdown and Development Approaches:

The budget request for the glossary is $300, covering UI, animation, glossary entries, and interactivity. Slate described two implementation options:

Option 1: Gamers Guild selects glossary terms, builds animations (Canva/GIFs), and adds entries manually.

Option 2: Launch a form/survey to gather term suggestions from guilds and use those inputs to prioritize entries.
A consensus was formed to use both methods, starting with a curated set and expanding via community submissions. The goal: 10 entries with animations by end of quarter.

A separate line item was proposed for glossary icons and gamified UI assets, mainly to allow flexible use of funds and clearer budget categorization. This item is part of the visual glossary development stream.
- Gamified Portal Demonstration

Slate reintroduced the Gamified Portal, a Zealy–DeWork hybrid platform for XP-based engagement. Users complete quests, explore tools, and earn XP; admins from each guild can manage tools, quests, and review submissions via their dashboard. He suggested that the Visual Glossary could either be:

Integrated directly into this portal,

Kept separate,

Or handed to the Education Guild for wiki integration.

The budget request for this was $450, covering front-end, back-end, testing, UI polishing, and community feedback handling.
- Admin & Coordination:

Slate presented the admin & coordination budget line ($360) covering:
Weekly syncs
Task tracking
Community coordination
Dework usage & announcements

Concerns were raised about whether it could accommodate all documentation and announcement tasks. A suggestion was made to rotate the announcements roster, and Gorga volunteered to set it up.
- Roblox Publishing Policy Update

Slate discussed new Roblox publishing restrictions (effective Sept 30, 2025), which require experiences to be verified via a Content Maturity Questionnaire. Unverified games will be marked "Unplayable." As a result, no new department budgets were requested this quarter. The team agreed to limit new builds temporarily until policy impact becomes clearer.
- New Map Creator Assignments:

Based on activity and past builds, the next department builders for the central river area are:
Kizzy and Devon
They are tasked with:
Extending the water area
Adding a bridge and creative elements (e.g., boats, signs)
Designing an entrance to the new university section
Slate granted them Roblox edit access during the call. Onfray needs to attend two consecutive
calls to get the Gamertag.
- Writers WorkGroup Department Creation Updates: 

Kizzy presented finalized animations for the Writer’s Workgroup:
All characters are animated and placed in respective areas (canteen, study, meeting room, social media). Dialogue animations are partially implemented, with a plan to expand them further. Roaming effects and transitions between rooms were also being tested.

#### Decision Items:
- No new Roblox departments will be added this quarter
  - [**rationale**] Due to platform verification delays.
- Rotation of Tasks 

#### Action Items:
- [**action**] Map creators  [**assignee**] LordKizzy, devon [**due**] 25 October 2025 [**status**] todo

#### Game Rules:
No games played
