#### Narrative:
The meeting opened with Clement welcoming everyone to our last meeting for this quarter. The meeting began with a recap of the previous session, which focused on digital financial assets and traditional banking experiences in Africa. The group discussed the Q4 2025 budget, which totals $1,900, with $600 allocated to recurring tasks and the remainder split between projects and workshops. They outlined various initiatives for the quarter, including the Lean Guild Challenge, Talking Drone Dispatch, and plans for Twitter spaces and village meetings. SucrenSpice mentioned creating an alternative budget based on a lower AJX price to account for recent fluctuations.

The team introduced a new quarterly initiative: a bi-weekly newsletter titled "Talking Drum Dispatch," designed to engage the community using Afrocentric naming and themes. Duke explained that the newsletter would be sent to the existing email database to help convert leads into warm or hot prospects for future events and funding opportunities. The team also addressed concerns about declining meeting attendance—Duke noted that while past events attracted up to 80 participants, recent turnout has been lower.

Duke emphasized the need for renewed marketing and lead nurturing through the Talking Drum Dispatch, targeting contacts from the past year with updates on TestNet, TestNet Africa, and AI in Africa. He also outlined plans for Afro AI storytelling videos and shorts, initially conceived as part of the Green Guild Challenge. SucrenSpice and Clement assisted in retrieving relevant details from the meeting transcript to support planning.

Duke announced the launch of the Lean Guild Challenge, a new competition aimed at promoting SingularityNet, AI, AGI, and Africa through creative ideas and potential video content. While the exact competition format is still being developed, Duke suggested possible collaboration with the video workgroup and promotion via the Marketing Guild and Ambassador Program’s YouTube channel. He also highlighted plans to revive X Spaces and support small, low-budget events, encouraging participants to focus on generating tangible outputs in the final two months of the quarter.

The team began planning a smaller-scale Lean creative competition with a modest $100 budget, modeled after a previous initiative. They agreed to form a focus group to structure the competition and generate ideas. Love volunteered to create a brief submission form for participants who prefer not to join live discussions. The competition will be open to both guild members and non-members, with plans to award prizes to the top three submissions—rather than just one winner—to boost participation and motivation.

The team discussed cross-guild content collaboration, agreeing to assign a delegation to engage with LATAM counterparts for Q1 2026 planning. They prioritized the first five items on their action list and began brainstorming topics for an upcoming African youth meeting. Duke suggested a topic on how AI could predict the rapture, which Love expressed interest in.
