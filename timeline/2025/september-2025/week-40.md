#### Town Hall Summary:
The discussion focused on the ambassador program's role in promoting beneficial AGI, with Ambassadors SingularityNET emphasizing the need for increased participation and engagement from contributors. The agenda included workgroup updates and the quarterly budget process, noting that the deadline for proposals had closed and quorum was achieved. Four workgroups faced objections that will be addressed in the upcoming governance call. Alfred reported on the temporary fundraising workgroup's efforts to tackle funding challenges due to low token prices, and Vani encouraged contributions to governance discussions.

Guillermo Lucero provided insights into governance developments, including updates on the R&D dashboard and recent hackathon participation, which featured a partnership with BNB through the ASI Alliance. He discussed the successful deployment of an agent to enhance platform interactions and the integration of the ICP agent into the governance dashboard for LATAM. Additionally, Guillermo emphasized the importance of AI tools for translation and instructional content improvement. There was acknowledgment of recent progress from LatAm Guild, and mention of R&D Guild's recent SEO optimisation research project and a call for further engagement from other workgroups with it.
