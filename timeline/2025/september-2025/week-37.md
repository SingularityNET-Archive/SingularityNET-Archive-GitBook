#### Agenda item 1 - Team Check-ins & Workgroup Management - [resolved]

#### Discussion Points:
- Participants shared personal updates and weekly activities, including virtual experiences, online courses, and routine project involvement, to build rapport.
Tevo initiated the standard process to select a meeting summarizer and a reviewer for the summary.
He specifically noted that this summary would be more challenging than usual due to the conversational and less structured nature of the retrospective, which would require careful capture of various viewpoints.


#### Decision Items:
- Alfred volunteered and was selected as the lead for drafting the meeting summary.
Uknowzork  took on the responsibility of reviewing the summary, finalizing, and publishing it.

#### Agenda item 2 - Q3 Retrospective - [carry over]

#### Discussion Points:
- Retrospective was also collected asynchronously on the Miro board, the zoom meeting chat, and the ongoing feedback form-Retrospective questions on what went well, what didn’t, impact, and next focus.
What went well: The onboarding process was highlighted as a major success. New members reported the overview document provided "exceptional clarity" and was "instrumental" to their integration, even serving as a benchmark that could improve the main Ambassador Program onboarding. The use of the Miro board was praised for making work organized and explainable. The feedback form effectively created recurring interest, and everyone contributed at least a little each meeting.
What didn't go well: Key challenges included low usage of GitBook outputs by general members, who primarily rely on Discord or each other for information. Participation remained inconsistent, and distributing/picking up tasks was still complicated. Formatting assets in Miro was confusing for new members despite guides, suggesting the process might be overly complex ("micro-managing"). The move to a monthly schedule reduced communication and led to missed meetings due to unclear scheduling.
Our Impact (Output vs. Outcome): The outcome was a more cohesive and learning-focused team. Impacts included learning to use AI in the organization process, improving logical thinking via GPT, and sharing methodologies (like with the ODIN network). Quantitatively, adding 2+ active contributors was a positive improvement.
Decision-Making Process: The process was deemed a success because it was decentralized, fair, and highly accessible to new members, making them feel included and able to contribute immediately.
Feedback Insights: A review of Town Hall feedback and survey results confirmed that while members are aware of the GitBook, they haven't found a reason to use it, preferring Discord and direct communication as their primary information sources.


#### Decision Items:
- The current decision-making and onboarding processes are highly effective and will be continued.
The group acknowledged the critical challenge of making the Knowledge Base a primary, useful resource instead of a secondary archive.

#### Agenda item 3 - Asset Management & GitBook Organization - [carry over]

#### Discussion Points:
- Members experienced technical difficulties with the Miro board voting feature, likely due to the board's size and complexity.
As an alternative to Miro voting, the group experimented with using a shared Google Sheet, which was found to be a more accessible method for collaboration on this task.
A suggestion was made to create a dedicated "archive" section within the GitBook to house older, less relevant documents without causing confusion for new members

#### Decision Items:
- The group decided to discard several outdated assets and not add them to the GitBook,

#### Agenda item 4 - Progress Report & Proposal Finalization - [carry over]

#### Discussion Points:
- Tevo provided an update on the Q4 proposal and progress report, mentioning his effort to create a unified, repeatable report format across all workgroups (Treasury, Process Guild, etc.).
A significant budget issue was raised: the time spent on asynchronous "documentation and support activities" has consistently exceeded the allocated budget.
To rectify this and ensure contributors are fairly compensated, Tevo proposed adding a new budget line item titled "General Support" to cover these essential but previously under-budgeted tasks.


#### Decision Items:
- The Q4 proposal will be amended to include a new budget line for "General Support."
A potential collaboration with R&D on a knowledge-based agent application was mentioned as an interesting future direction that needs more clarity and organization.


#### Action Items:
- [**action**] All workgroup members are requested to contribute their perspectives to the "Community Sentiment" section of the Q3 progress report.
Tevo will finalize the Q3 progress report and Q4 proposal and submit them.

## Thursday 11th September 2025

### African Guild

- **Type of meeting:** Biweekly
- **Present:** Clement Umoh [**facilitator**], UKnowZork [**documenter**], Clement Umoh, UKnowZork, Sucre n Spice, Kateri, Duke, martinsoki, esewilliams, Udoma, Jedidiah Omotayo, Omolola Lawson, Emmanuel Ita, Alfred Itodele
- **Purpose:** African Guild Meeting, 11th of September, 2025
- **Working Docs:**

#### Narrative:
The meeting opened with Clement welcoming everyone to the third phase of the Afro Multilingual Literacy Drive. He reminded participants that the initiative has already held a couple of series in the past, each one focused on a specific theme around learning and community growth. Today’s session, he explained, would revolve around Finance, with a central theme titled: “M-PESA & AI Guardian: Practicing Digital Money.”

To set the tone, Clement began with a short historical reflection. He began by reflecting on the past, noting how coins once served as our main form of transaction a few years back. He explained that M-PESA, widely used in Kenya, works much like what Opay and Moniepoint do in Nigeria—proving that financial innovation can be homegrown. Clement stressed that Africa is fertile ground for such innovations in financial literacy. However, he also pointed out the potential risks: digital wallets can be hacked, fraudsters exploit weaknesses in the system, and inflation can erode trust. This, he argued, is where AI can serve as a guardian, strengthening the security of Africa’s digital financial systems.

Clement emphasized how platforms like M-PESA, Airtel Money, and Opay have become “banks for the unbanked.” With nearly 60% of Sub-Saharan Africa’s population still unbanked, these platforms are more than convenient—they represent digital literacy and financial inclusion. 

He then moved to a more interactive part of the session. He asked the group whether anyone had personal experiences of how mobile money had impacted trade, family support, or community development in their lives. Jedidiah was the first to respond. He shared how mobile money had been a lifeline for him during particularly difficult times. He explained that in situations where access to physical cash or banks was limited, having a mobile wallet made the difference between being stranded and being supported. Duke followed by narrating his experience during the 2023 “No Cash” crisis in Nigeria, when physical currency was scarce, and daily transactions became a struggle. He recalled how PalmPay came to his rescue during a very difficult issue he faced. Since that experience, he has continued to use the platform regularly, though he admitted that he avoids keeping large sums of money in his account for safety reasons. Udoma added his own perspective, focusing on frustrations with traditional banks. He spoke about repeated cases of unnecessary charges, which he felt were unfair and exploitative. These experiences had led him to close multiple accounts over the years, further strengthening his reliance on digital platforms.

After hearing these contributions, Clement returned to the broader discussion. He pointed out that many of these digital financial platforms are now going beyond just storing money or processing transactions. Increasingly, they are integrating advanced tools that help detect fraudulent activity, verify customer identities, and even offer personalized financial advice to users. This, he suggested, demonstrates how digital money can become not only a tool of convenience but also a system of trust and guidance for users across Africa.

He then posed a thought-provoking question to the group: “Who should own the intelligence that protects Africa’s digital money?” His point was that while AI and advanced technologies can safeguard financial systems, the ownership and control of that intelligence remain a critical matter for Africa’s future.

Omotayo responded firmly, saying that Africans must be the ones to own and manage such intelligence. Since the financial assets belong to African users, the control and security systems around them should also remain within African hands. He emphasized that ownership is not just about technology it is about independence and empowerment.

Duke supported this idea and expanded on it. He argued that there is no need for Africa to abandon digital platforms in favor of offline methods. Instead, Africans should be given the tools and opportunities to protect and manage their digital assets themselves, without over-reliance on external systems.

The meeting came to an end with Clement reinforcing the idea that while digital money platforms have already proven themselves as powerful tools for inclusion, the future lies in ensuring that these tools are secure, accessible, and truly African-owned. The discussion, he noted, is not just about financial convenience it is about shaping the continent’s future in terms of trust, innovation, and self-reliance.
