#### Narrative:
The meeting opened with Clement welcoming everyone to the third phase of the Afro Multilingual Literacy Drive. He reminded participants that the initiative has already held a couple of series in the past, each one focused on a specific theme around learning and community growth. Today’s session, he explained, would revolve around Finance, with a central theme titled: “M-PESA & AI Guardian: Practicing Digital Money.”

To set the tone, Clement began with a short historical reflection. He began by reflecting on the past, noting how coins once served as our main form of transaction a few years back. He explained that M-PESA, widely used in Kenya, works much like what Opay and Moniepoint do in Nigeria—proving that financial innovation can be homegrown. Clement stressed that Africa is fertile ground for such innovations in financial literacy. However, he also pointed out the potential risks: digital wallets can be hacked, fraudsters exploit weaknesses in the system, and inflation can erode trust. This, he argued, is where AI can serve as a guardian, strengthening the security of Africa’s digital financial systems.

Clement emphasized how platforms like M-PESA, Airtel Money, and Opay have become “banks for the unbanked.” With nearly 60% of Sub-Saharan Africa’s population still unbanked, these platforms are more than convenient—they represent digital literacy and financial inclusion. 

He then moved to a more interactive part of the session. He asked the group whether anyone had personal experiences of how mobile money had impacted trade, family support, or community development in their lives. Jedidiah was the first to respond. He shared how mobile money had been a lifeline for him during particularly difficult times. He explained that in situations where access to physical cash or banks was limited, having a mobile wallet made the difference between being stranded and being supported. Duke followed by narrating his experience during the 2023 “No Cash” crisis in Nigeria, when physical currency was scarce, and daily transactions became a struggle. He recalled how PalmPay came to his rescue during a very difficult issue he faced. Since that experience, he has continued to use the platform regularly, though he admitted that he avoids keeping large sums of money in his account for safety reasons. Udoma added his own perspective, focusing on frustrations with traditional banks. He spoke about repeated cases of unnecessary charges, which he felt were unfair and exploitative. These experiences had led him to close multiple accounts over the years, further strengthening his reliance on digital platforms.

After hearing these contributions, Clement returned to the broader discussion. He pointed out that many of these digital financial platforms are now going beyond just storing money or processing transactions. Increasingly, they are integrating advanced tools that help detect fraudulent activity, verify customer identities, and even offer personalized financial advice to users. This, he suggested, demonstrates how digital money can become not only a tool of convenience but also a system of trust and guidance for users across Africa.

He then posed a thought-provoking question to the group: “Who should own the intelligence that protects Africa’s digital money?” His point was that while AI and advanced technologies can safeguard financial systems, the ownership and control of that intelligence remain a critical matter for Africa’s future.

Omotayo responded firmly, saying that Africans must be the ones to own and manage such intelligence. Since the financial assets belong to African users, the control and security systems around them should also remain within African hands. He emphasized that ownership is not just about technology it is about independence and empowerment.

Duke supported this idea and expanded on it. He argued that there is no need for Africa to abandon digital platforms in favor of offline methods. Instead, Africans should be given the tools and opportunities to protect and manage their digital assets themselves, without over-reliance on external systems.

The meeting came to an end with Clement reinforcing the idea that while digital money platforms have already proven themselves as powerful tools for inclusion, the future lies in ensuring that these tools are secure, accessible, and truly African-owned. The discussion, he noted, is not just about financial convenience it is about shaping the continent’s future in terms of trust, innovation, and self-reliance.
