#### Narrative:
The meeting began with Ayo welcoming everyone to the call.

Q2 Retrospect: Ayo discussed the challenges faced in Q2, particularly the effects of token depreciation on community engagement and the necessity for motivated members in the Strategy Guild. He noted that the devaluation of the token has demotivated contributors who seriously want to be active in strategy.
Daniel Effiom contributed by noting that the planned workshops had to adapt due to changes in workgroup schedules and a general decline in activity. He emphasized the importance of timely communication and updates within the ecosystem and encouraged that we should update the community on what we are doing via town hall meetings.

Q3 Budget Update: Daniel Effiom outlined the strategy Guild's budget, emphasizing that the core budget lines have not changed. He reported a decrease in available funds from $1,200 to $862 and mentioned the possibility of using reserves to cover any additional costs that may arise during the quarter. Effiom assured that all budget lines were accounted for and that any adjustments would be documented for transparency.

Workshop Update: Ayo discussed the difficulties faced during recent workshops due to a decline in contributor activeness. Kateri led the update and proposed two potential directions for upcoming workshops:

> Focusing on foundational workgroups, including Governance, AI Ethics, and Strategy.

> Focusing on support workgroups that give support to community such as Onboarding, Gamers, and Translation

After some discussion, the group leaned towards prioritizing the Support workgroups.

Research Update on SingularityNet AI Marketplace: Clement shared insights on research into the SingularityNET AI Marketplace. He explained that the research aims to identify knowledge gaps and improve engagement by including feedback from the Deep Funding community, which is crucial for understanding the marketplace’s usability. He highlighted the importance of knowledge transfer and communication in fostering greater involvement.
He stated the research framework objectives are Identify knowledge gaps, enhance community engagement, and assess understanding and awareness levels. The key research areas are; Understanding/awareness, engagement/utilization, communication/knowledge transfer, and strategic growth improvement. and that the methodology approach would be through Surveys, interviews, hands-on testing, polls, and comparative analysis of similar programs.

The meeting ended with Ayo noting that the tasks assigned should be concluded before the next monthly meeting to ensure the success of the guild.

#### In this meeting we discussed:
- Introduction and welcome: The meeting kicked off with Vasu welcoming everyone 

ASI1 latest update:
Vasu displayed the updated version of the ASI1 mini. He stated that there were some bugs but they’ve all been fixed and a memory function has been added.

- SEO keyword extraction issues: 
Vasu raised concerns regarding the SEO Research Assistant's output, which generated keywords instead of hashtags, leading to confusion. He proposed developing a specialized agent tool for social media content.

- AI Ethics and Governance Advisor Agent (EthosGuard): 
Vasu introduced his proposal for an AI agent centered on ethics and governance. Vani expressed concerns about the agent’s capacity to evaluate key Governance values, and stressed the need to preserve human oversight in decision-making processes stating that AI agents still lack contextual knowledge which limits effectiveness in decision making.

- Core Contributor Eligibility and Governance Dashboard: 
Vani highlighted the potential benefits of adding core contributor eligibility support and tracking to the governance dashboard, as it could help those who are not yet a Core Contributor to identify the requirements, and track what they still need to do in order to become one.
