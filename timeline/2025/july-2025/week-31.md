#### In this meeting we discussed:
- Introduction and welcome: The meeting kicked off with Vasu welcoming everyone 

ASI1 latest update:
Vasu displayed the updated version of the ASI1 mini. He stated that there were some bugs but they’ve all been fixed and a memory function has been added.

- SEO keyword extraction issues: 
Vasu raised concerns regarding the SEO Research Assistant's output, which generated keywords instead of hashtags, leading to confusion. He proposed developing a specialized agent tool for social media content.

- AI Ethics and Governance Advisor Agent (EthosGuard): 
Vasu introduced his proposal for an AI agent centered on ethics and governance. Vani expressed concerns about the agent’s capacity to evaluate key Governance values, and stressed the need to preserve human oversight in decision-making processes stating that AI agents still lack contextual knowledge which limits effectiveness in decision making.

- Core Contributor Eligibility and Governance Dashboard: 
Vani highlighted the potential benefits of adding core contributor eligibility support and tracking to the governance dashboard, as it could help those who are not yet a Core Contributor to identify the requirements, and track what they still need to do in order to become one.
