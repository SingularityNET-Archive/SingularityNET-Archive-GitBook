- **Purpose:** Regular Meeting of the AI Ethics WG
- **Working Docs:**
  - [AI Ethics GitHub Board](https://github.com/SingularityNet-Ambassador-Program/AI-Ethics-Workgroup/issues)

#### Narrative:
This is our first meeting of the quarter(Q3)!
We reviewed tasks from last quarter, categorized as “In Progress” on the GitHub board. For the unfinished Q2 transcription tasks (aside from Colleen’s), we’ve decided to fold them into the admin roles so they won't receive payment for them. The transcription needs to get done by the end of July, as we are a bit firm with deadlines now.
After further discussion from the Admin Team, we agreed that;
The WG needs to complete tasks quicker - things should not drag on for several months, and should at the very least be completed during the Quarter they are funded in.
Deadlines need to be set to allow time for tasks to be reassigned if the original assignee doesn't have time to complete them.
We need to be clearer that tasks will be reassigned if they're not completed by the deadline.
Going forward, no task will be paid during a Quarter if the token price is below the price at which the budget was calculated (so for Q3 2025, that's $0.30).
If the token price stays below $0.30 for the whole Quarter, then at the end of the Quarter, we will assess what we can't pay. Priority will be given to "output-based" tasks done by members, rather than admin roles.
We decided to change things up now because at first, we wanted people to get used to carrying out tasks in the WG.
Training materials have been revised and updated by Vani. Links here:Interview training AI Ethics WG; BGI Nexus Interviewers' handbook; Transcription training AI Ethics WG
Transcript Checking is ongoing and currently being done by Vani.
AI Ethics MOOC Study Group: The idea is to register for a free course on AI Ethics and meet weekly to discuss each module and the issues it raises. The most popular course is the “EdinburghX’s Data Ethics, AI and Responsible Innovation” but interested people in the study group need to finish the course by the 11th of August so they don't lose free access to it. The time for the weekly meet will be sorted out async. Course Link here: https://www.edx.org/learn/artificial-intelligence/the-university-of-edinburgh-data-ethics-ai-and-responsible-innovation 
Interviews: We’ve budgeted for 8 new half-hour interviews this quarter but we didn't include expenses so might have to take money from the budget for transcription tasks this quarter. Deadline for all Q3 interviews will be the 8th of August, any interview not done by then can either be reassigned or put the money back in the WG purse. The assignees so far are Clement(2x), Grandi(2x), UknowZork(2x), Rems, and Jeffery.
Interview Transcription: We might not get to do any Q3 transcriptions because we have to clear out the backlog from last quarter. Deadline to finish up old transcripts is the 31st of July. People up for transcripts are Clement, UknowZork, Jeffrey, Ashley, Barnabas, AdvanceAmeyaw, Maximilez, and Grandi.

- **Meeting video:** [Link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4dGsCqdRj6ct6TwdrVKm_Bjg2ToCjzQh)
- **Working Docs:**
  - [Archive names (a list of the name that people are most commonly known by in the Archives)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r5LDA7yiERtWuu-HHYsBiG-RLyjDCtTZUB8H-xZHFsE/edit?usp=sharing)

  - [GitHub Issue for this meeting](https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/273)
  - [Archives WG - types of corrections made to meeting summaries](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NaBXAtSiz4Gs7lJD7FGVOxghmI0Vtyks103qMqfK9n8/edit?usp=sharing)

#### Decision Items:
- As token price remains low, we still won't submit any pending Q1 tasks at the moment
  - [**rationale**] The Q1 budget was calculated at $0.55 so we're not there yet
  - [**opposing**] We might rethink in August, and pay outstanding Q1 tasks anyway
  - [**effect**] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- André's tool development in June (see https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/263) included:

- fixing an isssue with the Project Management task auto-creation (it wasn't adding the correct content)
- fixing a bug with "Working docs" field in meeting summaries
- fixing a bug that meant new summaries were not being posted properly to GitBook, due to an error with the date structure

Also Vani wrote a list of the types of corrections that get made to meeting summaries, to tie in with André's work in May and June on comparing summaries pre and post correction.
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- The WG's Q3 2025 budget got consent from the community with no objections.

We noted that this budget marks a shift in emphasis for Archives WG, away from archive maintenance and development of the Summary tool, and towards graph development. However, we intend that our work on the redesign of the summary tool will be reinstated in Q4 2025.

  - [**rationale**] Essentially, this is due to having a lower budget cap, and prioritising what we feel is the most significant and important area of our work at present.
But also - we now have a large corpus of meeting summaries, so we are able to shift our focus on how to use AI tooling to interrogate and use that corpus.
  - [**effect**] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- On the monthly archives GitBook issues: we noted that summaries are still being submitted without any chasing, so the Archives are fairly complete for Q2, and going well for July; although as previouly noted, there are fewer meetings happening in general.
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We noted that some meetings are still on the Calendar but are not happening. We will mention in the next WG Sync Call to ask WGs to tidy up their calendar entries, and will post in Ambassador-General Discord on the same.
  - [**rationale**] since we use the Calendar to check which meetings happened and have been summarised.
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We noted that the development repo on Rule-Based Auditing Neo4j development, which was temporarily on the QADAO Organization, has now been transferred to the SingularityNET-Archive - see https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/Graph-Development and pinned to the SNET Organization.

We also noted that the related Wiki contains a lot of useful content for people who want to explore what we are working on https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/Graph-Development/wiki
  - [**rationale**] To make the materials more accessible to the Ambassador Program
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- In July, Stephen and Vani's focus (see https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/274) will be on developing learning resources and community engagement around how to use Neo4.j and particularly, rule-based auditing. 
  - [**rationale**] Our approach is focused on auditing the results of a graph-based process; and, in line with the fact that thee Ambassador community has created the Archives corpus, we want to foster a sense of ownership of the data by enabling people to work with it.
- Peter mentioned the development of https://docs.qwello.ai/ elsewhere in sNET, and suggessted there might be some crossover with our work. 
  - [**rationale**] Qwello builds knowledge graphs out of people's documents (PDFs), whereas we are using GitBook and linked Googledocs) as our main source; plus, we have a focus on audit and examination of the results/outputs of a knowledge graph from an ethical and open-source perspective; so there are definitely points of connection.
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople

#### Action Items:
- [**action**] Vani has approached DeepFunding to ask if the Events Circle could take on documentation of DF Town Hall. They have a member who is interested in taking it on and would like training on how to use the summary tool. Vani to chase it up.
 [**assignee**] CallyFromAuron [**due**] 30 July 2025 [**status**] in progress
- [**action**] Andre to add Rems's name to the Archive Names controlled vocab [**assignee**] André [**due**] 11 July 2025 [**status**] todo
