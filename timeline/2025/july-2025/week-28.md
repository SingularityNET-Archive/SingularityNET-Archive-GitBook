#### Decision Items:
- As token price remains low, we still won't submit any pending Q1 tasks at the moment
  - [**rationale**] The Q1 budget was calculated at $0.55 so we're not there yet
  - [**opposing**] We might rethink in August, and pay outstanding Q1 tasks anyway
  - [**effect**] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- André's tool development in June (see https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/263) included:

- fixing an isssue with the Project Management task auto-creation (it wasn't adding the correct content)
- fixing a bug with "Working docs" field in meeting summaries
- fixing a bug that meant new summaries were not being posted properly to GitBook, due to an error with the date structure

Also Vani wrote a list of the types of corrections that get made to meeting summaries, to tie in with André's work in May and June on comparing summaries pre and post correction.

- The WG's Q3 2025 budget got consent from the community with no objections.

We noted that this budget marks a shift in emphasis for Archives WG, away from archive maintenance and development of the Summary tool, and towards graph development. However, we intend that our work on the redesign of the summary tool will be reinstated in Q4 2025.

  - [**rationale**] Essentially, this is due to having a lower budget cap, and prioritising what we feel is the most significant and important area of our work at present.
But also - we now have a large corpus of meeting summaries, so we are able to shift our focus on how to use AI tooling to interrogate and use that corpus.
  - [**effect**] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- On the monthly archives GitBook issues: we noted that summaries are still being submitted without any chasing, so the Archives are fairly complete for Q2, and going well for July; although as previouly noted, there are fewer meetings happening in general.
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We noted that some meetings are still on the Calendar but are not happening. We will mention in the next WG Sync Call to ask WGs to tidy up their calendar entries, and will post in Ambassador-General Discord on the same.
  - [**rationale**] since we use the Calendar to check which meetings happened and have been summarised.
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We noted that the development repo on Rule-Based Auditing Neo4j development, which was temporarily on the QADAO Organization, has now been transferred to the SingularityNET-Archive - see https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/Graph-Development and pinned to the SNET Organization.

We also noted that the related Wiki contains a lot of useful content for people who want to explore what we are working on https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/Graph-Development/wiki
  - [**rationale**] To make the materials more accessible to the Ambassador Program
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- In July, Stephen and Vani's focus (see https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/274) will be on developing learning resources and community engagement around how to use Neo4.j and particularly, rule-based auditing. 
  - [**rationale**] Our approach is focused on auditing the results of a graph-based process; and, in line with the fact that thee Ambassador community has created the Archives corpus, we want to foster a sense of ownership of the data by enabling people to work with it.
- Peter mentioned the development of https://docs.qwello.ai/ elsewhere in sNET, and suggessted there might be some crossover with our work. 
  - [**rationale**] Qwello builds knowledge graphs out of people's documents (PDFs), whereas we are using GitBook and linked Googledocs) as our main source; plus, we have a focus on audit and examination of the results/outputs of a knowledge graph from an ethical and open-source perspective; so there are definitely points of connection.
