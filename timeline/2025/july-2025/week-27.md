#### Narrative:
Governance Workgroup Tag: We agreed to give the Governance WG tag to Jeffrey, Maxmilez, UKnowZork, Iain Wentworth, Alfred, Rems and Love Owokere who have been attending for a while.

Tracking Issues and Governance Dashboard Updates: The topic for today’s meeting is “Ways of tracking issues that come up repeatedly during the Budget Consent Process. 
Tracking Issues and Governance Dashboard Updates: Looking forward to the launching of Ai agent application when it’s ready on governance dashboard to help in identifying such issues in the future.

Discussion on Addressing Recurring Objections and Workgroup Reserves: Addressing Recurring Objections and Workgroup Reserves; WGs having recurring objections can be invited for a meeting with the governance have a fair discussions to understand the reason for the recurring objections from the past quarter to be able to find a lasting solution, seeing Governance as the right platform to have such meeting.

Discussion on Work Group Outcomes and Governance: Quality of work and output:  the reason most of the questions on quality of work and output surfaces most times might be due to not having clarity on outcomes of most contents and most times it is difficult to point it out. 

Discussion on Outcomes vs. Outputs in Budget Approvals: WGs should point out the details of what they are doing and the outcomes giving examples of content creation and the engagement they have had and the content shared on social media platforms.
Quarterly reports should point out the effects of what WGs have achieved at the end of every quarter and what they plan to achieve in the quarter ahead as they are to put more concentration on outcomes than outputs and KPIS.

R&D Challenges and Improvement Strategies: The R&D Guild as an example of failing on different experiments and after every failure observed there is always a room for correction and coming up with new Ideas and making sure it’s been addressed and more effort is been put in place to make sure it succeeds.

Collaborative Approaches to Workgroup Challenges: We believe  if there will be by any means a follow-up on WGs and Guilds to address issues that keep coming up And also having outcomes in the balance sheet of tokens spent every quarter  to avoid same issues coming up over again. (Just a thought)

Decision-Making Framework and Work Group Participation: We should find a way in having WGs collaborate whereby members of other WGs are allowed to look into each other’s work and effort and try to find a way in making every task accomplished and also have a better outcome, at least it will help also.

  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- WG reserves will be another topic, and we need to ask workgroups to look at what their leftovers are and how they're managing their reserves.
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We should do some direct work with each WG about defining their outcomes, and their intended impact, and how they will achieve it (like a mini Theory of Change) and 4a) We agreed that it might be possible to use Program reserves to fund this, though we did not definitely agree it - it needs to be picked up in a later meeting
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We could start by work shopping the above in a Governance meeting or a TH with one workgroup, as a demonstration
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We agreed it would be good to train WGs how to manage token fluctuation when paying, e.g. pricing tasks in AGIX, although they would not have to adopt any particular approach
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
