#### Narrative:
Governance Workgroup Tag: We agreed to give the Governance WG tag to Jeffrey, Maxmilez, UKnowZork, Iain Wentworth, Alfred, Rems and Love Owokere who have been attending for a while.

Tracking Issues and Governance Dashboard Updates: The topic for today’s meeting is “Ways of tracking issues that come up repeatedly during the Budget Consent Process. 
Tracking Issues and Governance Dashboard Updates: Looking forward to the launching of Ai agent application when it’s ready on governance dashboard to help in identifying such issues in the future.

Discussion on Addressing Recurring Objections and Workgroup Reserves: Addressing Recurring Objections and Workgroup Reserves; WGs having recurring objections can be invited for a meeting with the governance have a fair discussions to understand the reason for the recurring objections from the past quarter to be able to find a lasting solution, seeing Governance as the right platform to have such meeting.

Discussion on Work Group Outcomes and Governance: Quality of work and output:  the reason most of the questions on quality of work and output surfaces most times might be due to not having clarity on outcomes of most contents and most times it is difficult to point it out. 

Discussion on Outcomes vs. Outputs in Budget Approvals: WGs should point out the details of what they are doing and the outcomes giving examples of content creation and the engagement they have had and the content shared on social media platforms.
Quarterly reports should point out the effects of what WGs have achieved at the end of every quarter and what they plan to achieve in the quarter ahead as they are to put more concentration on outcomes than outputs and KPIS.

R&D Challenges and Improvement Strategies: The R&D Guild as an example of failing on different experiments and after every failure observed there is always a room for correction and coming up with new Ideas and making sure it’s been addressed and more effort is been put in place to make sure it succeeds.

Collaborative Approaches to Workgroup Challenges: We believe  if there will be by any means a follow-up on WGs and Guilds to address issues that keep coming up And also having outcomes in the balance sheet of tokens spent every quarter  to avoid same issues coming up over again. (Just a thought)

Decision-Making Framework and Work Group Participation: We should find a way in having WGs collaborate whereby members of other WGs are allowed to look into each other’s work and effort and try to find a way in making every task accomplished and also have a better outcome, at least it will help also.

## Friday 4th July 2025

### African Guild

- **Type of meeting:** Weekly
- **Present:** esewilliams [**facilitator**], UKnowZork [**documenter**], advanceameyaw, Duke, Jeffrey Ndarake, Alfred Itodele, esewilliams, UKnowZork
- **Purpose:** Bi-weekly meeting of the African guild 
- **Working Docs:**

#### Narrative:
Intro: The session opened with Ese expressing concern over the low attendance in recent guild meetings. She pointed out that not only have fewer people been joining the calls, but active participation during the meetings has also declined. She asked if anyone present had attended the last session facilitated by Clement. Advance briefly recapped what was discussed in that session, and Jeffery chimed in, stating that while he had joined the call, he didn’t catch enough context to contribute meaningfully or recall detailed discussions.

Highlights/Upcoming Events: Shifting the discussion toward the root of the issue, Ese asked the group how they believed participation could be improved. In response, Advance suggested that the decline might be due to financial challenges particularly referencing how the recent token price drop had affected multiple workgroups and guilds, potentially demotivating members. Building on this, UknowZork pointed out that the last two or three sessions facilitated by Duke had also seen very poor attendance, and this trend could be tied to the current bi-weekly meeting schedule, which, in her view, had dampened the spirit of the guild. She proposed returning to a weekly meeting structure to bring back engagement.

Advance supported this idea, agreeing that the bi-weekly format had reduced both effectiveness and enthusiasm among members. At this point, Ese posed a key question: “Given our current budget and the drop in token value, can we realistically support weekly meetings?” UknowZork responded by suggesting a partial shift toward volunteerism, especially for tasks like facilitation. She proposed using these roles as mentorship opportunities where members could learn how to lead meetings, even if the tasks aren’t currently funded.

While the proposal had merit, Advance expressed hesitation, indicating that while volunteerism is a thoughtful approach, it might not be sustainable at this time. Jeffery added another layer of concern, noting that it would be unfair to expect new contributors who haven’t previously benefited from paid opportunities to volunteer, especially when others in the past had earned during more favorable conditions.

Recognizing all these perspectives, Ese cautioned that while the suggestions were valuable, any changes must be made carefully. She reflected on a time when the African Guild had consistently high participation and vibrant energy, but acknowledged that the token price crash played a major role in shifting that dynamic. To move forward, Advance and Jeffery both recommended reaching out directly to inactive guild members to understand their needs and encourage engagement. They also discussed the idea of sharing regular reminders in the guild’s Discord channel to help boost meeting turnout.


AOB: Before wrapping up, Advance threw in a refreshing idea: “Why don’t we make the meetings more fun maybe add something cultural or playful to keep things lively?” Like little activities that remind us of home and bring back the sense of community. Ese loved the suggestion and encouraged everyone to think about creative ways we can make the sessions get lively and get more participation. The call ended on a hopeful note, with Advance offering to personally reach out to some guild members on Discord to help reignite that sense of connection.
