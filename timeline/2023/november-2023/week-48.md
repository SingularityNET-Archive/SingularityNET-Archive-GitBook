# Week 48

{% embed url="https://github.com/orgs/SingularityNET-Archive/projects/1/views/3?itemId=39607712&pane=issue" %}

## Monday 27th November 2023 <a href="#docs-internal-guid-84cfb7a9-7fff-824e-5202-8f090fdfea67" id="docs-internal-guid-84cfb7a9-7fff-824e-5202-8f090fdfea67"></a>

### <mark style="color:green;">Education Guild</mark>

#### Present:

Headelf \[facilitator] \[documentor], Peter, Osmium, Waka, Slate, Curtis, Kenechi, Malik

#### Agenda:

Ambassador certification education - project infographics

#### Notes

We discussed last meeting's acceptance of Malik's infographic from Canva as the standard.&#x20;

[https://www.canva.com/p/templates/EAFnU1DnEZw-dark-illustration-7-steps-personal-development-infographic-poster/](https://www.canva.com/p/templates/EAFnU1DnEZw-dark-illustration-7-steps-personal-development-infographic-poster/)

We then discussed the direction of the project.&#x20;

\[decision] We reached consensus on each of us taking one project and creating an infographic (using the template above) adhering to the Who, What, When, Where, Why, How, Token, and Any critical info.

Curtis brought up SLTs (student learning targets), and agreed that the 5Ws would be a good SLT 101 for students. So in a consensual fashion SLT 101 for ACP (ambassador certification program) will be Who, What, When, Where, Why, How, and Token (5Ws) of each project as per the developed infographic.

Conversation then turned to testing and certification. Headelf brought up the video, & the further homework that each project would require.

Peter mentioned the Friday Marketing initiative where spinoff project experts were invited. He stated it might be a good way to gain their insights into what critical info would/should be included in the infographic SLTs.&#x20;

Discussed testing and procedures. \
\[decision] Consensus was a quiz of ten questions after a student viewed the project video and the infographic. Gaming, cheating, open book, etc were discussed prior to consensus on the test and recognizing the quiz was an additional learning reinforcement process.

It was recognized there would be a dozen projects to cover. A comprehensive exam of around 100 questions after a candidate took all 12 Project Learning Segments (PLS). This received loose agreement, as I believe all recognized this would need further discussion as the course evolved.

We each took a project, $20 bounty, to create an infographic per the template and following the 5Ws. We will start comparing and critiquing next week.

#### Meeting length:

1 hour.

#### Purpose:

The purpose of the meeting was to discuss how the SNET ambassadors can better support and share resources with the SNET spin-offs and to find out what the spin-offs need most support with.

#### In this meeting we discussed: &#x20;

**NOTE:** A good portion of the information was confidential / project internal. There is a full meeting summary with details available upon request for Ambassadors/ WG Leads; this one is a more general one.

* Gave the spin-offs an introduction to SingularityNET Ambassadors program and the different guilds/ workgroups
* Shared an overview of what services the Ambassadors can offer to the spin-offs
* Spin-off representatives shared what their current needs are, some upcoming projects, and how they would like to be supported. (Shared from: Russell from SDAO / SophiaVerse, Sandra G. from Cogito, Romi k. from Mindplex, Axel from Rejuve.bio, Stuart from Rejuve.ai)
* Discussed possible ways to organize task management: Having a new main Dework for task management vs using the Snet Dework with sub workspaces for each project?
* Discussed possible ways to make communication between each other easier (New Telegram channel vs Ambassador Discord?)&#x20;
* Since most spin-offs would like help with amplifying their messages and growing their audience would it make sense to have an amplifying workgroup?
* Should we onboard community members from other spin-offs to the Ambassadors Discord or should they grow their own Discords?&#x20;

#### Decisions and action items:

**NOTE:** Full information with details on partnership specifics are available upon request by Ambassadors; alternatively they will be discussed

\[action] Judith to follow up to share resources requested by spin-offs (links, slides, groups etc)\
\[action] Judith to follow up with spin-off reps regarding partnership details and further discuss/ advance those\
