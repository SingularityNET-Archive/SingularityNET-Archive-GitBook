### <mark style="color:green;">Education Guild</mark>

#### Present:

Curtis; Waka; Peter; Headelf \[facilitator] \[documenter]

#### Agenda:

Video Education

#### Summary:

Headelf shared his Intro video on SNet. 32 sec.\
Peter shared his Intro video on SNet 1min10sec.\
Curtis asked about who is the target audience. Discussion followed.\
WaKa responded to Headelf's inquiry on Google Class with ‘it's a rich full-blown system’.\
Discussion centered around Peter's more detailed longer video. \
The balance of the meeting was with Headelf working on editing Peter's video in real time. We replaced stock photos with custom-made by Headelf. Some of the on-the-fly editing left the graphic out of proportion.\
A long discussion was held about an Outgo video after the intro and the "meat & potatoes". Is a splash for each project possible or needed? \
Brand assists were raised.\
WaKa brought up personalized education by AI for individuals.

#### Meeting length:

1 hour 25 minutes.

#### Action items:

**\[Action]** Work on a 30-second outgo.

### <mark style="color:green;">Onboarding Workgroup</mark>

#### People present: <a href="#docs-internal-guid-a1b8555f-7fff-c102-2db5-3cae567f7493" id="docs-internal-guid-a1b8555f-7fff-c102-2db5-3cae567f7493"></a>

Peter \[Facilitator]; Love \[Documenter]; Sucre n Spice; Vani; Nwobi

#### In this meeting we discussed:

Minutes from the last meeting\
Paying LilyCupcake for more of a “timeless” version of the onboarding video.\
Imagery in the onboarding video.\
The payment structure for Onboarding WG\
Onboarding WG tag and who's going to give the tag to respective members in Discord.\
The kind of proof to show for engagement and onboarding of new members to the SNET ambassador program.\
Continuous Onboarding (How to support other WGs in onboarding new members to their meetings and more).\
Giving a short survey form for people to express how they feel about the onboarding process.

#### Decisions:

**\[Decision]** We agreed that people can only apply for tasks in the Onboarding Dework if they have the “Onboarding workgroup member” tag in Discord as the Onboarding Dework space is now only accessible to people with the tag.\
**\[Decision]** We agreed to submit proof of DM-TO-DM onboarding and engagement with new members of the SNET ambassador program fortnightly or weekly so proof of fund request will not be required.

#### Action items:

**\[Action]** Sucre to tweak the scripts and relay the imagery in the onboarding video to LilyCupcake.\
**\[Action]** Peter to give every member of the onboarding WG the onboarding WG role on Discord.\
**\[Action]** Vani and LordKizzy to make the 1st draft for the onboarding survey and bring it to the next meeting.

#### Learning points:

Giving screenshots or something tangible for every engagement and onboarding of new members done by Sucre might compromise people’s privacy.

We should try reinforcing the onboarding messages on how to get involved in a particular WG(e.g. In the onboarding WG, all you need to do is show up for meetings) in order to get a clear and concise message across to new/old members.

#### To carry over for the next meeting:

Check [Getting Started doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q4dhediWgcbgAP3Wfsky\_-roVyfCUe6xi-dhBdHbU4s/edit?usp=sharing) - (15 mins) Have any new comments been added? Turning it into a Twitter thread as suggested by Peter - this was to stay on the agenda for decision in a future meeting.

We should reach out to other WGs and ask for a bit of their time during their meetings to find out how they onboard new/old members to their meetings while explaining things from our perspectives

#### Keywords:

**Topics covered:** Onboarding, Dework, Privacy, Survey, Collaboration, Permissions, Video.\

## Friday 3rd November 2023

### <mark style="color:green;">Marketing Guild</mark>

#### Present:

Mihai Bărbulescu; jay.05 | Judith W; headelf; Peter E; Tevo; Fly; Rojo; Kenichi.

#### In this meeting we discussed:

#### Should the Outreach/Marketing Guild be kept running or is it enough to have 2 people with outreach role that can coordinate between Writers WG and Video WG as well as spin-off projects?

* It should be kept. From there people can chose workgroups: Writing, Video or Outreach
* It makes sense to have a body that's collaborating with writers WG, video WG and outreach roles
* Risk: Are we micromanaging too much?
* Who would lead the Outreach/Marketing Guild? Fly, who has been leading it, isn't inside the workgroups but wants to contribute but not lead it
* Weekly meetings might not be needed. Meetings could be scheduled when needed only.
* How many people will be needed for the outreach role? 2 might be good to start with

#### What should the responsibilities of the outreach role holders be?

* Stay on top with events happening across SNet and understand what's happening in the next months&#x20;
* Outreach to spin-off projects to find out how we can support them/ what we can create for them
* Decide what the main marketing focus should be
* Communicate to each workgroup what content needs to go out&#x20;
* Make sure the workgroups are communicating (They have alignment on what content goes out)
* Outreach to external organisations that could collaborate with SNet
* Social media coordination between workgroup content ,especially Writers' and Video WG
* Amplifying messages on social media from the whole ecosystem

#### Should we put increased effort into amplifying the messages of other spin-off projects on the Ambassadors' X (Twitter) account?

* It makes sense to create more content about the other spin-off projects
* Risk: Too many tweets /too spammy - people will mute?
* What do people want to see on Twitter?Are they here for Ambassador program updates or SNet project updates?
* How do we decide what's being posted in the sea of content in the SNet ecosystem? There are so many projects, it's challenging to amplify every message.

#### How can we best offer our services/support to the other spin-off projects?

* How can they request a task?
* Should they create their tasks in Dework for us? Do they know how to use Dework? (Will need to get feedback from them)
* Should we have the outreach role coordinators get the info from projects on what tasks are needed and create the tasks for them? (Could be very time consuming!)
* We could offer a Google doc template for them to input task info. We can then turn it into Dework task for them.
* Should workgroups decide on the pricing for each task, or should we have standardised rates, or should the spin-off projects themselves decide what they want to pay?
* Charging a service fee to cover SNet costs is definitely needed ( treasury etc): Proposed: 5-10% charge&#x20;
* What currency should it be charged in? Their token or AGIX?
* How do we establish a point of contact? Invite them to Town Hall session or outreach by an individual person with an outreach role?
* Should we reach out with a defined offer/service?  Risk: It will restrict their creativity to come up with what they truly need.
* Should we ask them what exactly they need? Risk: We shouldn't bend for them. They might ask for things we can’t offer

#### What specific services could we provide/ offer as a package?

* Translation
* Video production
* Writing
* Outreach to establish external partner leads/relationships
* Town Hall hosting service w/ Breakout room
* Developers (If we have capacity)
* Process modelling / Process maps (If Tevo has capacity)
* Take meeting notes / produce meeting summaries
* Create documentation
* Help them set up or manage their own Ambassadors program:
* Full Ambassador’s package/ Consultations (Treasury, Dework, Note taking…)

#### Decisions:  <a href="#docs-internal-guid-4dd7003b-7fff-9e69-0fe6-e11a495e2037" id="docs-internal-guid-4dd7003b-7fff-9e69-0fe6-e11a495e2037"></a>

We need more time to ideate on each item, discussion will continue next Friday 12 UTC\
In the meantime: create a Google doc to continue brainstorming (See action items)

#### Action items:

Judith to create a Google document where we can continue brainstorming collaboratively on:

* Who are the points of contacts for each spinoff project?
* What questions do we want to ask them?
* What responsibilities should a person with the ‘outreach role’ have?&#x20;
* What workgroups want to offer their services?
* What services could we potentially offer?

### <mark style="color:green;">Video Workgroup</mark>

#### Present:&#x20;

Rojo \[facilitator], Judith \[documentor], Peter. E, headelf, OEP, lord\_kizzy, Kenichi

#### In this meeting we:&#x20;

* Discussed Workgroup videos that have recently been posted
* Discussed ways to improve the appeal of our current videos for example: adding a headline to our videos, adding auto caption, changing the background, and discussed the best placement for those video elements
* Discussed additional task requirements to add to Dework to make the task instruction clearer and ensure a higher standard of videos (additional task requirements: auto-caption, headline, solid background)
* Discussed the idea of having a Q\&A document with solutions to the most commonly asked questions by our members (many members are asking questions in DMs -> the answers get lost / need to be repeated)
* Discussed whether or not we should have the announced video optimization workshop as an interactive workshop or as a written cheat sheet

#### Decisions:&#x20;

\[decision] To start adding a main caption (headline) to our videos to let people know what they are watching (also as a hook to get people to stop scrolling)\
\[decision] Instead of extending the blurred background to fit the whole frame of the video we will add a solid colour background (there we will place the auto caption and headline)\
\[decision] To brainstorm a suitable headline for the Town Hall summary videos\
\[decision] To add more info/requirements to Dework task description eg. auto-captions, headline caption, and solid background if applicable\
\[decision] All videos should have auto-captions without exception because many people watch videos without sound\
\[decision] To make a Q\&A document with the most common problems of workgroup members and their solutions and share it in the video group and then add it to our Carrd page\
\[decision] To always proof-read auto-captions to avoid mistakes\
\[decision] To add sound to the Town Hall summary video ( we will trial this)\
\[decision] To show the headline in the video thumbnail\
\[decision] To ask workgroup members if they would prefer the announced video optimization workshop as an online workshop or document&#x20;

#### Action items

\[action] Add additional task requirements to Dework: auto-captions that will be proof-read, solid background (if video doesn't fit the full frame), headline/ video caption to add context to videos\
\[action] To share a Q\&A document in the workgroup chat where members can ask their most common questions, they will then be answered and the document will be shared to our Carrd page (or pinned to the group chat)\
\[action] To add sound to the next Town Hall summary video (give it a try first before we make it a requirement)\
\[action] Ask members in the group if they prefer the announced video workgroup as an online workshop or as a cheat-sheet document\
\[action] Brainstorm catchy headline for Town Hall summary videos
