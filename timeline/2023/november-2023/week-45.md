### <mark style="color:green;">Education Guild</mark>

#### Present:

Peter; Fly; Osmium; WaKa; Rojo; Psycho42069; Headelf \[facilitator]; Headelf \[documenter]

#### Agenda:

Ambassador self education

#### Summary:

#### 1) 7-minute video created by Headelf

The video was a 30-sec intro and 40-sec outro with a older fluff meat and potatoes. Intro and outro were an attempt at building condenses for the structure of the model, to then put out rework tasks for writers and video workgroup to build the education library.

Feedback: the audio sucked. Ben's or Sophia's voice may be better.

A brief convo on ethics of using AI voices.

#### 2) Fly suggested we use Galaxy Platform or Zealy to get people to do the videos

#### 3) WaKa asked if the projects had content of their own we could use.&#x20;

#### 4) WaKa asked what tool/platform we will use for tracking or quizzes.

#### 5) Target audience - why we donâ€™t aim the videos to everyone? Why the Ambassadors?&#x20;

This question has been raised and answered every session for the last 5 or 6 meetings. The target audience was set at Ambassadors.

Conversation covered generational perceptions, and age profile of Ambassadors.

Conversation covered decentralization.

#### 6) Vieweing Peter's video

Peter finally got to play his video, after 1 hour and 27 minutes.

Video was very well done.

1 hour 29 minutes.

## Friday 10th November 2023

### <mark style="color:green;">Marketing Guild</mark>

#### Present:&#x20;

jay.05 | Judith W., Peter E, Rojo, Slate, Kenichi, Lord\_kizzy

#### In this meeting we discussed:&#x20;

* the strategy we will adopt for the initial outreach to the SingularityNet spin-off projects as well as which channels will be best for outreach and what message we want to reach out with initially
* how many of us and who will handle the initial outreach and that the best strategy for now will be to have two people reach out to Snet spin-off projects first to see if there is any interest in collaborating with the Ambassadorâ€™s workgroups on tasks that need to be done, before we start assigning outreach coordinator roles to interested Guild members
* ideas on how we will reward the outreach coordinator role and whether or not we want spin-off projects to pay for that, whether or not a service fee should be worked into a margin of the price we are going to charge for any work we will do for them, or if compensation for outreach should come front he marketing budget as the marketing budget would increase when spin-off projects hire us for tasks
* Dework access and set up for Judith to be able to manage the Marketing Guild meetings and any tasks associated with it
* the results of the polls that were put up by Judith in the Marketing Guild chat

#### Decisions:&#x20;

\[decision] To start the outreach to all spin-off projects next week with two people in charge of initial outreach before we determine how many members will take on the outreach role (dependent on response/interest from Snet spin-offs).

\[decision] It was voted to keep the name of this Guild as â€˜Marketing Guildâ€™ (Voted through poll in Marketing Guild chat).

\[decision] It was voted to run Marketing Guild Sessions whenever needed (Voted through poll in Marketing Guild chat), however currently they will still be weekly meetings until we fully figured out the outreach process.

\[decision] It was voted that each spin-off project should have their own Snet Ambassadors program representative, (however we still need to figure out how doable this actually is and how many members are ultimately interested in participating in outreach) (Voted through poll in Marketing Guild chat).

\[decision]  Judith will prepare + host future Marketing Guild meetings and has permission to put up tasks to the Marketing Guild Dework

#### Action Items:&#x20;

\[action] Judith to set up a message chat with Slate and Peter to coordinate who reached out to which spin-off project, and for Peter to possibly help with point of contacts for those

\[action] To facilitate the outreach to Snet spin-off point of contacts through various channels over the upcoming week and report back to the Guild Members by Friday (Slate and Judith, with help of Peter)

\[action]  To give Judith permission to add tasks on Dework (Marketing Guild only)
