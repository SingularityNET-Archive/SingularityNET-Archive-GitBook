#### Present:

Peter; Fly; Osmium; WaKa; Rojo; Psycho42069; Headelf \[facilitator]; Headelf \[documenter]

#### Agenda:

Ambassador self education

#### Summary:

#### 1) 7-minute video created by Headelf

The video was a 30-sec intro and 40-sec outro with a older fluff meat and potatoes. Intro and outro were an attempt at building condenses for the structure of the model, to then put out rework tasks for writers and video workgroup to build the education library.

Feedback: the audio sucked. Ben's or Sophia's voice may be better.

A brief convo on ethics of using AI voices.

#### 2) Fly suggested we use Galaxy Platform or Zealy to get people to do the videos

#### 3) WaKa asked if the projects had content of their own we could use.&#x20;

#### 4) WaKa asked what tool/platform we will use for tracking or quizzes.

#### 5) Target audience - why we donâ€™t aim the videos to everyone? Why the Ambassadors?&#x20;

This question has been raised and answered every session for the last 5 or 6 meetings. The target audience was set at Ambassadors.

Conversation covered generational perceptions, and age profile of Ambassadors.

Conversation covered decentralization.

#### 6) Vieweing Peter's video

Peter finally got to play his video, after 1 hour and 27 minutes.

Video was very well done.

1 hour 29 minutes.
