#### Summary&#x20;

The Ambassador Program aims to provide a way for community members to contribute to the vision of Singularity Net by self-organizing into work groups. The Process Guild, Marketing Guild, Writers Guild, and Video Guild all had updates at the meeting, discussing topics such as tokenomics, licenses, tools, and content creation. They are now using Zoom for their meetings and AI to record meeting notes. They are also looking into creating a Medium account.

Rojo encouraged ambassadors to join a community on main net to test the platform using tokens from the payment sheet. They are also looking at Summon and Clarity platforms for recording votes and decisions on chain. Incubation workshop is taking place on Wednesdays at 19 UTC to discuss work group leads, budget allocations, and open topics. Strategy is discussing Felix's governance framework and the summit, as well as ethics and responsibilities of ambassadors. QA-DAO is setting up an open source infrastructure for the Ambassador program and is drafting a proposal for the work group. The Educational Skills work group is meeting at 21 UTC on Mondays.

The FreysDeFi discussed the potential for the Singularity Net Ambassadors Guild to provide education on AI, including hosting seminars, summarizing educational materials, writing articles and videos, and introducing a reputation system for rating AI products. They also discussed collaborating with academics and educational institutions. The Decentralized Governance Summit was also discussed, with the intention of electing a renewed Supervisory Council and ideating on the process.

### Summon Platform Review

Hosted by Tommy Frey

Ambassadors SingularityNET discussed setting up a video work group and creating a community, multi-sig wallet, and poll on the Nami platform. They discussed the features of the platform, such as creating a community, multi-sig wallet, and poll, and how to assign voting power to different tokens. They also discussed the option to upload a file when toggling the snapshot.

Ambassadors SingularityNET is excited about the upcoming Agora voter feature, which will allow for voting to be recorded on chain with smart contracts. They are also looking into multi sig wallets for community management, which would require on chain data. The presentation was concluded with Tommy Frey thanking Roger for a good job.

### Incubation Workshop



## Thursday, 27th April 2023

### AI Sandbox

With Felix and Fly

11 Participants

#### Summary

(edited read.ai transcript)

David and Felix discussed the use of AI tools, the introduction of LLMs, and the concept of context windows. They also discussed the importance of teaching each other and exploring together. Stephen shared his knowledge on the mathematical basis of LLMs and GPT, and Tevo Saks discussed the concept of a prompt and context window.

Felix and Tevo Saks discussed how to formulate a prompt for Chat GPT, and David suggested testing out prompts with both GPT 3.5 and 4.0. Headelf asked why the response was in a male voice, and David suggested that it is an ongoing problem in the AI community to make data inclusive for everyone.

Felix suggests that the group use AI tools to create a product within the singularity ecosystem that fails at its purpose. David suggests that the group join break-out rooms and come up with ideas for products that fail. Peter Elfrink has to leave early, and Felix, David, Tevo Saks, and Stephen - QA-DAO decide to break into rooms and come up with ideas for products that fail using AI tools. They will then share their ideas with the group.

#### Fly's prompt suggestion

Please forget all prior prompts. I want you to become my Prompt Creator. Your goal is to help me build the best detailed prompt for my needs. This prompt will be used by you, ChatGPT. Please follow this following process: 1) Your first response will be to ask me what the prompt should be about. I will provide my answer, but we will need to improve it through continual iterations by going through the next steps. 2) Based on my input, you will generate 3 sections. a) Revised prompt \[provide your rewritten prompt. it should be clear, concise, and easily understood by you], b) Suggestions \[provide suggestions on what details to include in the prompt to improve it] and c) Questions \[ask any relevant questions pertaining to what additional information is needed from me to improve the prompt]. 3. We will continue this iterative process with me providing additional information to you and you updating the prompt in the Revised prompt section until it's complete. I want you to rate every prompt I give you or you produce. Give a rating 1 to 10. Add comments on what you think could have been improved about it. Do this for every prompt. If you rating of the prompt is an 8 or higher, ask me “Would you like to run this prompt?” With a menu choice of “Yes” or “No”. If I say “Yes” run the last prompt you suggested. If I say no generate me a better prompt. It is vital to make sure you run a prompt when I say “Yes”. Please continue this prompt until I say stop or you run the prompt. Thank you

#### Context Windows

#### GPT 3 - "What is a context window ?"

In natural language processing and machine learning, a context window refers to a specific range or window of words or tokens that are considered in relation to a target word or token. The context window provides the surrounding words or tokens that help provide meaning, context, and relevance to the target word. The size of the context window can vary and is typically defined by the number of words or tokens included before and after the target word. By analyzing the words within the context window, language models can better understand the relationships, dependencies, and semantic information associated with the target word. Context windows are commonly used in tasks such as word embeddings, language modeling, and various NLP tasks that rely on understanding word contexts and dependencies.

{% embed url="https://deepfunding.ai/" %}

Quick heads up on the topics for tonight’s Governance call:&#x20;

\- Quick look back on the reputation rewards resolution and next steps&#x20;

\- Discuss the pools for the governance round&#x20;

\- Discuss the starting date of the governance round, in the context of the ongoing/overlapping? Supervisory Council feedback inventory&#x20;

\- If we have time left we can discuss the feedback pools of the above and perhaps even create some input there!&#x20;

\- Any other topic that might be appropriate and urgent enough.

Should we wait the Supervisory Council vote before starting the Governance Round?

#### Summary (read.ai - edited)

Jan Horlings announced the election of the Supervisory Council and asked for the community's input on what they expect from the Council. Five pools have been created to collect feedback and the input will be used to elect the Council. The Council will be part of the internal team, but also part of the community and will be responsible for more than just Deep Funding.

The Supervisory Council is a centralized arm of Singularity Net that will experiment and learn how to do proper governance. It will eventually envelope the whole of the foundation, and the Council will have an important role in the governance of Sing Dao. The Council will mediate and be a sounding board for both the community and the internal team, advising and helping to explore how to do things. The Community will be responsible for electing the Council and deciding which proposals should be awarded.

Jan Horlings suggested that the community discuss their expectations for the new Supervisory Council and then move quickly to the election process. He suggested that the election process and deep funding should be kept separate, but that the Supervisory Council could have an influence on deep funding. He also suggested that a poll could be used to gauge the temperature of the room and that a video could be made to explain the process. Peter Elfrink suggested that a community call could be held to discuss the process.

Tevo Saks and Jan Horlings discussed voting and brainstorming ideas for proposals. They discussed the use of Swae as a platform for collecting feedback and the possibility of using Discord or Telegram to trigger discussion. Kenric Nelson suggested that the election of people to the Council should be its own item, and Grace Rachmany suggested that running all the pools together could reduce fatigue. Mauro Andreoli suggested having multiple pools with specific rules and goals.

Mauro Andreoli suggested that different pools should be created to organize proposals and Jan Horlings proposed that at least four pools should be created, plus a generic pool, to discuss topics such as peer reviews, strategies to prevent gaming, rewards planning, improving results through education and awareness, and budgeting. The community voted in favor of this proposal and Jan Horlings suggested that they should rephrase the categories and give it a try.

Jan Horlings proposed creating a Discord channel to collaborate on ideas and align them, and Mauro Andreoli suggested creating a new server for Deep Funding to make it easier to find specific links. Jan Horlings mentioned that there is an ongoing discussion about moving to a different platform, and Peter Elfrink suggested using a combination of retrospective and deduction to help guide people through the process. Everyone agreed that communication is essential and thanked each other for their ideas and initiatives.
