The Process Guild, Marketing Guild, Writers Guild, and Video Guild all had updates at the meeting, discussing topics such as tokenomics, licenses, tools, and content creation. They are now using Zoom for their meetings and AI to record meeting notes. They are also looking into creating a Medium account.

Rojo encouraged ambassadors to join a community on main net to test the platform using tokens from the payment sheet. They are also looking at Summon and Clarity platforms for recording votes and decisions on chain. Incubation workshop is taking place on Wednesdays at 19 UTC to discuss work group leads, budget allocations, and open topics. Strategy is discussing Felix's governance framework and the summit, as well as ethics and responsibilities of ambassadors.
