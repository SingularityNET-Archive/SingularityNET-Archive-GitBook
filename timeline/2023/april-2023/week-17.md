### Ambassador Town Hall #45

Ambassador Town Hall #45 was hosted by Peter Elfrink. There were 28 participants.

#### Summary&#x20;

The Ambassador Program aims to provide a way for community members to contribute to the vision of Singularity Net by self-organizing into work groups. The Process Guild, Marketing Guild, Writers Guild, and Video Guild all had updates at the meeting, discussing topics such as tokenomics, licenses, tools, and content creation. They are now using Zoom for their meetings and AI to record meeting notes. They are also looking into creating a Medium account.

Rojo encouraged ambassadors to join a community on main net to test the platform using tokens from the payment sheet. They are also looking at Summon and Clarity platforms for recording votes and decisions on chain. Incubation workshop is taking place on Wednesdays at 19 UTC to discuss work group leads, budget allocations, and open topics. Strategy is discussing Felix's governance framework and the summit, as well as ethics and responsibilities of ambassadors. QA-DAO is setting up an open source infrastructure for the Ambassador program and is drafting a proposal for the work group. The Educational Skills work group is meeting at 21 UTC on Mondays.

The FreysDeFi discussed the potential for the Singularity Net Ambassadors Guild to provide education on AI, including hosting seminars, summarizing educational materials, writing articles and videos, and introducing a reputation system for rating AI products. They also discussed collaborating with academics and educational institutions. The Decentralized Governance Summit was also discussed, with the intention of electing a renewed Supervisory Council and ideating on the process.

With Felix and Fly

#### Fly's prompt suggestion

Please forget all prior prompts. I want you to become my Prompt Creator. Your goal is to help me build the best detailed prompt for my needs. This prompt will be used by you, ChatGPT. Please follow this following process: 1) Your first response will be to ask me what the prompt should be about. I will provide my answer, but we will need to improve it through continual iterations by going through the next steps. 2) Based on my input, you will generate 3 sections. a) Revised prompt \[provide your rewritten prompt. it should be clear, concise, and easily understood by you], b) Suggestions \[provide suggestions on what details to include in the prompt to improve it] and c) Questions \[ask any relevant questions pertaining to what additional information is needed from me to improve the prompt]. 3. We will continue this iterative process with me providing additional information to you and you updating the prompt in the Revised prompt section until it's complete. I want you to rate every prompt I give you or you produce. Give a rating 1 to 10. Add comments on what you think could have been improved about it. Do this for every prompt. If you rating of the prompt is an 8 or higher, ask me “Would you like to run this prompt?” With a menu choice of “Yes” or “No”. If I say “Yes” run the last prompt you suggested. If I say no generate me a better prompt. It is vital to make sure you run a prompt when I say “Yes”. Please continue this prompt until I say stop or you run the prompt. Thank you

#### Context Windows

#### GPT 3 - "What is a context window ?"

In natural language processing and machine learning, a context window refers to a specific range or window of words or tokens that are considered in relation to a target word or token. The context window provides the surrounding words or tokens that help provide meaning, context, and relevance to the target word. The size of the context window can vary and is typically defined by the number of words or tokens included before and after the target word. By analyzing the words within the context window, language models can better understand the relationships, dependencies, and semantic information associated with the target word. Context windows are commonly used in tasks such as word embeddings, language modeling, and various NLP tasks that rely on understanding word contexts and dependencies.
