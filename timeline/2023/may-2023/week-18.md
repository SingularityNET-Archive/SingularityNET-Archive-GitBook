# Week 18

## Monday, 1st May 2023

### Education Guild

This meeting was facilitated by headelf and TheFreysDeFi

#### Agenda

Education Guild Agenda 5.1.2023

#### Education Guild Introduction&#x20;

#### Ideation

What is The SingularityNet ambassador program's role as educators in the SingularityNet ecosystem?

\-Internal guild education versus external. Are they really separate processes? How do we reduce our internal time to learn process?

\-Is this endeavor limited to within the Guild or do we develop partnerships to assist? How do we engage Institutions of Higher Learning to assist us? Does the guild create a platform or process to make it easy for institutions to onboard without guidance(open source) or do we embark on an invitation style onboarding?&#x20;

How can workgroups enhance the process of education.&#x20;

\-How do we engage AI/AGI tooling to assist us in developing the best education program possible?

As we engage on these topics perhaps we keep in mind our decentralization ethos and commitment to open source.

There are many more topics to be discussed that should be added to the agenda, but due to what is expected as heavy and in depth discussion the agenda is initially limited to these four questions and introduction.
