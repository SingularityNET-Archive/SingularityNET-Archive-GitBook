# Week 18

## Monday, 1st May 2023

### Education Guild

This meeting was facilitated by headelf and TheFreysDeFi

#### Agenda

Education Guild Agenda 5.1.2023

#### Education Guild Introduction&#x20;

#### Ideation

What is The SingularityNet ambassador program's role as educators in the SingularityNet ecosystem?

\-Internal guild education versus external. Are they really separate processes? How do we reduce our internal time to learn process?

\-Is this endeavor limited to within the Guild or do we develop partnerships to assist? How do we engage Institutions of Higher Learning to assist us? Does the guild create a platform or process to make it easy for institutions to onboard without guidance(open source) or do we embark on an invitation style onboarding?&#x20;

How can workgroups enhance the process of education.&#x20;

\-How do we engage AI/AGI tooling to assist us in developing the best education program possible?

As we engage on these topics perhaps we keep in mind our decentralization ethos and commitment to open source.

There are many more topics to be discussed that should be added to the agenda, but due to what is expected as heavy and in depth discussion the agenda is initially limited to these four questions and introduction.

### Incubation Workshop

#### Hosted by Fly and Crandano

Welcome at the weekly Ambassadors Incubation Workgroup. Join us to get direct insights and updates from the Ambassadors program, meet and connect with community members and find guidance and support for becoming a member of the SingularityNET Ambassadors program.

#### Attendees:&#x20;

Iain, Stephen, headelf, Peter E, Felix, Freys, cran, rojo, sucren, kenichi, ericS, blankgodd

#### Agenda Items:&#x20;

Direction of Incubation Workgroup, AI Tools budget, New Ambassadors

#### Length of Meeting:

2 hours

#### Goal or Action Items:&#x20;

Yes to $200 budget for AI Tools, Yes to 4 new Ambassadors: Freys, Sucren, Kenichi, Stephen

#### Brief Summary:&#x20;

Fly suggested using a paid account for the AI community tools, and Stephen mentioned the potential cost implications. The group discussed the pros and cons of using open source versus closed source tools, and the possibility of having multiple accounts for different purposes. They also discussed the possibility of having a sign up form for community members to propose ideas and topics for the incubation meetings.

Fly proposed a cap of $200 for AI tools and Tommy Frey suggested that the same amount should be allocated for work group leads, with a minimum number of hours put in. The group agreed and decided to move on to discuss group leads and rewards.

Tommy Frey suggested a verbal vote to elevate four people to the ambassador role, which was agreed upon by the group. Stephen and Kevin recused themselves from the vote due to being on the ballot. Rojo suggested an anonymous vote on a platform such as Poll Maker to ensure no one felt coerced. Tommy Frey suggested referring to the notes from the previous vote to ensure clarity.

Tommy Frey suggested that the four new ambassadors be voted in as a group, and the group discussed the implications of this decision. They also discussed the process of becoming an ambassador and the need for transparency. In the end, they decided to vote in the four new ambassadors as a group, but to also discuss the process of becoming an ambassador further.

#### Presentation

#### Direction of Incubation

What are the things in Ambassador program that need “incubation”?

How would you (community) like to contribute to the incubation workgroup:-

1. Community members propose ideas and topics on a signup form during the week, which are then covered during incubation?
2. Community members propose ideas and topics at the start of each incubation meeting?
3. Leaders of Incubation come up with topic for community contributions?

#### AI Community Tools

Do you have any more tools we want to use?

How should accounts be managed?

1. Each Ambassador has a paid account?
2. A paid account open for all Ambassadors?
3. One paid account for Ambassadors; one for wider community?

Do you have any more tools we want to use?

#### Workgroup/Guild Leads

* Goal: a solution until we look at the budget again by beginning of July
* In previous discussion we agreed to reimburse rewards at 1,875 AGIX/mo
* Should we use this as a solution for the quarter as we experiment with new Guilds and Workgroup Leads?
  * Leads could also not be capped to not double dip into other rewards within the program (ie: ability to do tasks)
* Do you believe an hourly rate of rewards is more appropriate?
* What amount?
  * 1,875 AGIX/mo rewards is equivalent to $562.50. At $10/hr that’s 13hrs/wk. At $15/hr that’s close to 9hrs/wk. $20/hr is 6.5hrs/wk.

#### Our role in SingComDAO - Not Discussed

With the upcoming election and call for proposals on the Swae platform, how can we self organise?&#x20;

Who will make a proposal on the swae platform?

How can we incubate people “stepping up”?
