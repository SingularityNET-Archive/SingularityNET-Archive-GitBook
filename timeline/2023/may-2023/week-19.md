{% embed url="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BFlTKeoIz2wcPYtp_iT8wpdlk3YvRMjCuqCFEDtsDeA/edit?usp=sharing" %}

#### Length of Meeting: 1 hr&#x20;

#### Goal and or Action Items:&#x20;

To provide a setting for questions, opinions, feedback, and ideas for Archive’s proposal&#x20;

Brief Summary: We began the meeting with Stephen\[QADAO] going over their current work with the archive of the Ambassador Program along with their proposal. Afterwards, the meeting was open for questions. Budget was among those questions and something the program is still putting their feelers out for the best way to move forward for things like new workgroup proposals. The Archive Proposal will continue to be discussed in Thursday’s Treasury meeting.&#x20;

Other questions and subjects: Training LLM’s with any particular objectives? Revenue streams for this data and work? Could this be supplemented at some point by avenues like a Deep Funding proposal? Partnerships potential Ambassador Program is still working on the best way forward for decision making which was highlighted at the end. Where do we vote and how? It seems many agree with the potential of anonymous voting.

### Strategy Guild

#### Hosted by Tommy Frey

Best Practice -Facilitating a Virtual Meeting.

Community discussion  - Organizing and Facilitating a Virtual SNET meeting.

Set a goal(s) for yourself for what the meeting is going to achieve.  You do not need to share as this beginning step is to guide you as you ideate on the meeting topics.  One high priority goal is typically best.  This is the one item you want to achieve before the meeting ends.  Several secondary goals are often good to have but not needed.

Set an agenda for the meeting. This could be one major concept or 3-4 topics of what the meeting is planning to cover.  You may want to number the agenda items for effect. There are several purposes for the agenda.  First is for you as the facilitator to act as your guide throughout the meeting.  Second is for your audience.  It provides a gentle pre-notice of the allowable topics to be covered so your meeting goal is achieved.  Third, it acts as guard rails for when the conversation gets off topic either unintentionally or when an actor hijacks it.  You can use the agenda offensively (but not in an offensive manner) with your audience to bring the meeting topic back on track.

Print the agenda for your audience and either hand out at an in-person meeting or post it for a virtual meeting. Make certain that all of your audience is able to read a copy of the agenda prior to the meeting or at the very beginning.

Welcome everyone to your meeting.  If it is a smaller group, welcome and thank them for attending. You establish a positive connection with your audience by mentioning their name.  During a meeting try to make everyone feel special.

At the very beginning of any meeting you should cover Housekeeping items.  In an IRL meeting this might include telling everyone where rest rooms and emergency exits are located.  In a virtual meeting tell your audience what your ground rules are.  Do you want a raised hand that you will recognize with a Mic off policy or is it okay for a respectful open Mic discussion.  How long do you expect the meeting to last.  Break timing, etc.   It is your meeting but you need to manage expectations to get the most from your audience.  By setting rules and attending to Housekeeping you are demonstrating your concern for them.

As you start the meeting after Housekeeping you should consider using the age old speaker technique of:Tell them what you are going to tell them; Tell them; Tell them what you told them.  Translated - Tell your audience what the agenda items are.  Then get into the meeting.  At the end of the meeting, summarize by telling them what you covered.

Start your meeting with the very first agenda item.  Hint; A professionally run meeting is when the facilitator does very little talking.  Your role is to frame the agenda item and start eliciting response from your audience.  You should be jotting notes of the key points your audience is covering.  Recap what your audience said - as you heard it.  This can be used as a tool to curtail discussion or lead an interesting concept into deeper discussion

Calling on participants is a method to engage everyone and get shy or reluctant participants involved.  Hint: do not ambush anyone.  Give everyone a heads up before you call on them.  It might be something like “ oh in a minute I’m going to ask John for his view on ….”  Say a few other things and then go back and ask John for his view.  By doing this you gave John time to prepare.

Cover your agenda items in order. However, do not rush your meeting just to cover all items.  If an agenda item is not finalized you can either sidetrack it for further discussion, kill it if it is too difficult or work the meeting until you solve it and bring closure.  Now you should realize the importance of the goal setting in step one.  Did your meeting meet your goal?

At the beginning of the end of the meeting, wrap around to summarize what was covered and what everyone achieved by having the meeting.  This shows respect for peoples time and demonstrates your gratitude for what was achieved.  Also include here a reminder of any and all action items from your notes.

The end of the meeting, after your summary should first ask if anyone has final thoughts and then thank everyone.

### Stakepool Incubation

#### Cryptofly777

Hey guys!

Sorry, I completely missed this.

I just added this comment to the google docs form but I notice that there hasn't been much action on it since it was first floated so I will post it here to make sure it isn't missed.

In respects to:

"Resource generation: The stake pool can generate additional income for the SingularityNET Ambassador program, supporting the development of new AI services and the expansion of the platform."

With the current hardware requirements for a Stake Pool, you will need to run 2 relays with 16GB Ram, with at least another 4GB of Swap memory. Unless someone is willing to provide bare metal for the servers, the cloud costs for this on average is $80-$110 a month each.

The block producer needs 32GB of Ram and this usually becomes a dedicated CPU rather than a shared. The costs jump dramatically to around $300-$400 for this instance.

Total being around $500 a month on a cloud provider.

With the current price of ADA, you will need around 30m ADA staked to break even on this endeavour.

This is including tax considerations, and the costs of someone running the pool and marketing efforts.

I'm not exactly a fan of this idea. It is INCREDIBLY difficult to attract stake to a pool and you would need to be offering significant amounts of SNet universe tokens to attract any meaningful amount of stake... even with the reach that SNet already has.

I think that this idea should be parked until ADA has recovered to a significantly higher value of around $1-$1.50

Until then, I think that we should follow NuNets lead and work with community pools who have always been favourable towards AI or SNet.

We could get these pools onboard and have them talking to their communities in exchange for some small random airdrops of tokens.

Running a pool now is likely to cost us money rather than generating additional income.

All of the other outcomes that we are aiming for can be achieved by working with established community SPOs

Community empowerment - We will achieve wider decentralisation by working with 10-20 SPOs rather than a singular stakepool of our own

Enhanced collaboration - People will be more willing to work with us if it attracts stake to their pool and we can harness the already established communities.

Financial incentives - Same as if staking to a SNet pool

Greater visibility - I believe working with established communities pools would give us greater visibility again

Can help facilitate creating the staking service on Cardano, For instance if SingularityNet follows the AMM model the ada funds can be staked to generate income. - This is where running our own pool will be ideal HOWEVER, with liquid staking like we have in Indigo, people may prefer that their ADA stays staked in their pools that they are currently in, rather than having it staked to a pool that we/SNet dictates to them.

Just writing all of this here because the meeting times usually fall in times that I can't attend. 🙂

{% embed url="https://proposals.deepfunding.ai/challenge-info/ff80c68c-9985-462b-a62e-350fc9dd4002" %}

Supervisory Council Election: Proposals related to the length of the commission

For how long should we be commissioning the renewed Supervisory Council? There are 2 main perspectives to take into account here:

1\. The work and mandate of the Supervisory Council might evolve from SeedSingComDAO to early SingComDAO to matured SingComDAO. This might be a reason to call for a shorter period.

2\. If we are aiming for high profiled individuals, they may be more interested in making an effort if the commission period is longer.

Peter proposal - Appoint the SC for full Seed phase duration

* Seed-SingComDAO timeframe should guide SC election.
* SC elected for the duration of Seed-SingComDAO.
* New election once Seed-SingComDAO transitions to SCDAO.
* Election period approximately 6-9 months.
* Full ownership of seed-singcomdao process for elected SC members.
* 2-year appointment period for SCDAO.
* Forced re-election after 2 years.
* SC members can re-apply for re-election.

#### Jan comment - Concerns

* New SC should guide the first stage of SCDAO for a proper start.
* Ensures implementation of proposals they have been part of.
* Initial period: 3-6 months for Seed phase and another 6 months for startup.
* Clarify responsibilities and time investment during this period.
* Good starting point for the next election.

#### Grace comment - Strengths

* Initial stewardship should have limited involvement.
* First phase: Create structures/whitepaper for SCDAO.
* Second phase: Oversight of vision implementation (Startup phase).
* Transition moment allows members to step down or be replaced.
* New election may not be necessary for continuity.
* Long-term council elections should occur annually.
* Half of the council is replaced each year.
* Two-year terms with at least half having one year's experience.
* Rolling elections promote continuity of knowledge.

#### Outcomes / conclusions

Mauro was concerned about the length of the election. Limit opportunities to re-election. 1 year is a lot of time in the blockchain environment.

6 months would be preferable. Define limits of re-election would 1 complete. 1 year of poor performance could be ingrained

Iain likes the overlap between candidates for continuity. Term limits.&#x20;

Consideration of mechanism of recall to address performance contributions.

Mauro - if you do not limit power at the beginning that invites problems. Re-election 3 times in 2 year period as Grace suggests.

Iain - key if SC plays a role of connection between communities they have to have trust of community - so SC needs to be accountable. Endorsed by the community.

Looking at it in phases makes a lot of sense.

Mauro - always better in Seed testing with a short period of time - 6 months of terms. Then assess whether more time is needed.To anticipate people's frustrations. 6 months sufficient time to assess performance.&#x20;

https://forum.cardano.org/t/the-layout-of-the-cip-1694-that-amazed-me/116294

#### Outcomes

term limits. Too long length of time a concern

Legitimacy of council and proper oversight.

Staged re-election is a good idea to retain knowledge

Comment by Grace: It feels like we also might need a code of conduct so that someone could be eliminated from the Council for serious breaches or lack of activity.
