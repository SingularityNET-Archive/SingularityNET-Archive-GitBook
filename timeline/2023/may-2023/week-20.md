#### GPT Prompt

File upload to GPT

Generate a Js script that creates a button with the text ‘Submit File’ and inserts it into the DOM before an element with the class ‘.flex.flex-col.w-full.py-2.flex-grow.md:py-3.md:pl-4’. The button should have a green background color, white text color, 5px padding, no border, 5px border radius and 5px margin. The script should also create a progress element and insert it into the DOM before the same element. The progress element should have a width of 99%, height of 5px and a grey background color. Inside the progress element, there should be another div element representing the progress bar with a width of 0%, height of 100% and blue background color. When the button is clicked, it should create an input element of type ‘file’ that accepts ‘.txt’, ‘.js’, ‘.py’, ‘.html’, ‘.css’, ‘.json’ and ‘.csv’ files. Once a file is selected, using an async it should be read as text and split into chunks of size 15000. using async Each chunk should be submitted into a conversation by doing the following: async function submitConversation(text, part, filename) { const textarea = document.querySelector("textarea\[tabindex='0']"); const enterKeyEvent = new KeyboardEvent("keydown", { bubbles: true, cancelable: true, keyCode: 13, }); textarea.value = `Part ${part} of ${filename}: \n\n ${text}`; textarea.dispatchEvent(enterKeyEvent); }. The progress bar should be updated after each chunk is submitted within the for loop as follows progressBar.style.width = `${((i + 1) / numChunks) * 100}%`; and should also check if chatgpt is ready with this code: chatgptReady = false; while (!chatgptReady) { await new Promise((resolve) =＞ setTimeout(resolve, 1000)); chatgptReady = !document.querySelector( ".text-2xl ＞ span:not(.invisible)" Once all chunks have been submitted, the progress bar should turn blue.

### Incubation Workshop

Hosted by Cran and Fly

#### Attendees:&#x20;

slysyl, iain, stephen, headelf, peter, felix, freys, fly, cran, syntronix, rojo, vani

#### Agenda Items:&#x20;

Open discussion based around what people perceive as the point to the SNET Ambassador Program

#### Length of Meeting: 1 hr

Goal and or Action Items:&#x20;

To provide a setting for questions, opinions, feedback, and ideas for the open discussion topic.

#### Brief Summary:&#x20;

We had an open conversation about what everyone sees the Ambassador Program as and becoming.

Here’s some various parts of conversation:

**Peter** - “_The way I open the Town Halls is that the program is about spreading the word on SNET. We need some refinement. I’ve been thinking about how spreading the word is one thing, then what? We need to fill in that blank space. Give people a framework or guidelines connected to SNET community._”

**Freys** - “_Biggest thing I heard from Peter is spread the word then what? I know some people are more focused on governance and various aspects. Not everyone wants to be interested in the same thing. We want to supplement each other. I want to see things go with education getting people used to and working with AI and AGI tools in their daily lives_.”

**Rojo** - “_I see this on two layers. Abstract: I see that our role as a community as organized community members. Show the public the skies and heavens of the AI. Also show them the depths of hell which is something disregarded heavily. By showing two sides of the story we make sure more people are involved. Stay close to heaven. Be vigilant that it can be used against them. On a practical and applied front I see our role being the main funnel that gets people involved. You don’t have to be a dev, make videos, or articles to be involved._”

**Felix** - “_What changed from my perspective a lot is when SingComDAO started. The responsibility of not only figuring out our own governance but also the larger governance of the community. The Ambassador Program is able to build community environment around not only their own program but also the whole ecosystem_.”

**Stephen** mentions community building and the need to build first in relation to capacity. **Alex** brought up a website idea for the program.
