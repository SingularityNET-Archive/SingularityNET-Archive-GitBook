Q : Is there any info you share with them?\
A : At the end of the session we do a little exploration of sNET - eg last session we talked about Ben Goertzel twin in Decentraland. It takes a bit of prep.

Q : Are there any onboarding tasks they are required to do?\
A : getting poeple to know Gamers Guild - people might not engage with online meeting - shifting timeslot for session

Q : How do they officially become a member?\
A : No official role - anyone's free to join. Winning game = rewards!

Q : What is your retention rate?\
A : Frequency of joining is good, and people do tend to keep coming back - only 1 session
