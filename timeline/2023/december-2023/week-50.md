#### Present:

Headelf \[facilitator] \[documenter], Curtis (PureRelativity), Rojo, Malik, Kenichi

#### Agenda:&#x20;

Infographics, Platform, Video

#### Notes

Meeting jumped into a long convo on which educational platform to use for the ACC. Discussed at length were Kahoots, Andamio and Google Classroom. All had proponents and pros and cons. While Google Classroom may be the more expensive or on a par with Kahoots, it was felt to be the quickest and easiest to set up and use. Andamio would require some coding.&#x20;

Curtis, who also was a proponent of Andamio, asked about the use and scalability of Google Classroom for beyond Education Guild. Headelf stated that one consideration was that Strategy Guild might also use the platoform for training in mediation. Curtis was interested if we could use it for marketing, etc and what the expense would be. TBD.

\[decision] Consensus was reached that Google Class was easiest and should be tried.

We are waiting on several infographics still.

#### Meeting length

1 hour

#### Action items:

\[action] Enroll in Google Class.\
\[action]Build out rest of infographics.\
\[action] Rojo to do the infographic for OpenCog Hyperon.&#x20;

### <mark style="color:green;">Strategy Guild</mark>

#### Present

Headelf \[facilitator] \[documenter], Rojo, Osminium, Peter

#### Agenda:&#x20;

Topic Town Hall meeting, Round Table, Product Development

#### Notes

The first half of the meeting was lacking Peter. The attendees discussed the positives of the TH meeting on 12th December 2023 that did a retrospective of the year.

We discussed the Round Table document and the continued need for a Mediation team. It was suggested that perhaps the Strategy Guild should evolve, and add in Mediation as part of its responsibilities since it brought about the Document.

Rojo suggested we adopt the Round Table parameters within Strategy Guild as part of its mandate. That way we could explore its parameters without affecting anyone outside of the Strategy Guild. If another individual or guild would like to use the principles, they would do so within the Strategy Guild. This was tabled for further ideation.

Peter joined the meeting at the halfway point as he had messaged he would. The conversation turned to what was the difference between the Round Table and the Mediation team. Long conversation followed. It was questioned and noted that only one actual ambassador had not consented to the document, and that editing outside the group had started up again after the Town Hall on 12th Dec, by individuals that had not commented on it during its 5 week comment period.

#### Meeting length

1 hour

#### Action items

\[action] Ideation on a Mediation Team.\
\[action] Ideation on Strategy Guild adopting the Round Table principles.
