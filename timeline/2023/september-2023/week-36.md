#### Notes:&#x20;

Not many notes for this meeting. I am finding it more difficult to facilitate, edit and scribe.

The meeting focused on the editing of the async google doc that had been created and edited by community members.&#x20;

Discussion focused on debate, gentle argument and consensus on the many topics in the Code of Conduct doc that had evolved from Strategy's previous doc termed Code of Ethics. This doc had been fed into CGPT4.0 and prompted to create a CoC with the viewpoint of a Professor of Ethics, with an avenue for reporting and possible violation remedies. The doc was about 3 pages long. The doc link is: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BISlzoy56n1bU-UdgKIqo\_Dub2w0fANCI-MlPuUVTIc/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BISlzoy56n1bU-UdgKIqo\_Dub2w0fANCI-MlPuUVTIc/edit?usp=sharing)&#x20;

#### Length of meeting:
