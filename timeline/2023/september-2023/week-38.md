## Monday 18th September 2023 <a href="#docs-internal-guid-565643b2-7fff-f227-7377-f80e405da06c" id="docs-internal-guid-565643b2-7fff-f227-7377-f80e405da06c"></a>

### <mark style="color:green;">Education Guild</mark>

#### Meeting Location:&#x20;

Ambassadors Discord event channel

#### Attendees:

Headelf \[facilitator] \[documentor], Felix, Fly, Osminimum, Peter, Roberto, WaKa, Tuso, Daemon Sprites. Later, Ese Williams, Fuji.AR.

#### Agenda:&#x20;

Educational videos for outbound-facing ambassadors using AI video and/or Knowledge Graphs, about the sNet ecosystem.

#### Meeting notes:

Osminimum shared an AI video he created. Suggested we do videos on what we do. He is using Runway, Midjournry & OGI??. Peter suggested we pipeline white papers and feed Invideo. Suggested we prefer tokenized ones over others since most of the roadmap is done. Suggested Sdao, Nunet & Hypercycle.

Someone suggested Sophiaverse, another S Dao Studio (if still extant).Headelf suggested focusing on one and multiple parties make video to then compare styles, etc so we have consistency. He said we may have more but using ten as the number of current spinoffs.

Fly suggested that each person make a video on project of their choice and we compare.

Daemon Sprites said GPT3 was good to use to self-educate. Then discussed his NFT project.

Roberto talked about Gimbalabs, Andamio and PBL (project-based learning) as a great learning process. Headelf acknowledged and indicated that we have a Dework PBL Workgroup.

Felix noted that each sNet Workgroup is different and has own processes.

Headelf reiterated for first-timers that the past Education meeting(s) were about creating a series of educational videos for more advanced or involved Ambassadors to level them up to public presentations. These videos were not for onboarding as we have an Onboarding workgroup. The concept had been to make one on each spinoff then have a test and to certify. Fly mentioned he did not like tests and preferred experience. Headelf suggested perhaps hold a AMA like in a Dissertation.

Daemon asked why we would need to educate people, suggesting that if they were Ambassadors they should have self-educated and suggested using AI and Chat got for them to self educate. He then suggested we bring experts in like Gimbalabs and use PBL.

Peter suggested we could do educational focus groups on various education for Ambassadors.

Roberto asked what does media training (previously discussed by Headelf as one potential) have to do with education. We should focus on just delivering the message. Education should use their SLT (student learning techniques). That Ambassadors need to learn how to just deliver a message.

Felix raised the question of what is sNet and relative time, Past, Present and Future. What is the genesis of sNet and its history, suggesting this might be the focus of ambassador education. Headelf who was also scribing indicated he warped into a Paradigm shift and had focused on that and lost some of the context of the convo including Peter's, Roberto's and Felix's. Ai is more than the Marketplace. The why of AGI and Singularity.

Headelf brought up in answer to some strong opinions from Daemon about what the Ambassador program and the Ambassadors should be functioning as, that we have not figured it all out. He made a statement that the sNet in transparency and decentralization had no rules when it started 1.5 years ago, no mandate per se, no guardrails, and a light hand on the tiller. He checked with Felix, Rojo, Fly and Peter who were there at the beginning. They concurred. The sNet program is in constant development. Felix stated that decentralization did not mean no rules.

It was towards the end of a very lively and spirited convo that there were plenty of educational needs and we had multiple workgroups to help.

#### Meeting duration:

&#x20;1.5 hours.

#### Action items:&#x20;

Do we discontinue the initiative because Ambassadors should self educate? \
Do we focus on Onboarding education? \
Do we continue with outward focused Ambassador education? \
**\[Action]** Document and concurrent convo to continue in Discord, and follow up next week.

#### **Agenda Items**&#x20;

#### **1) Insights from Treasury Guild related to specific tasks**&#x20;

**Description** - When we audit tasks we select a few tasks to be looked at that where there are mistakes or questions about costs. We found this method to be good way to provide a feedback loop to improve our task recognition. \
**\[Decision]** - We agreed that Treasury Guild can start holding off task rewards when we notice mistakes or high costs.\
**\[Decision]** - Treasury Guild will notify assignees of the reasons for holding off rewards in the Treasury Guild channel.\
**\[Decision]** - If possible we clarify rewards async in Treasury Guild Channel \
**\[Decision]** - alternatively we bring these issues to the Treasury Guild call for collective discussions.\
**\[Decision]** - When Dework PBL runs out of the initially requested budget and we have not reached the monthly Ambassador budget limit, we will double the rewards for Dework PBL workgroup contributors. \
**Insight** - Sometimes tasks do not have an accurate amount of task points because of previous templates or task duplications, which then gives a false warning to the Treasury Guild about the time spent and funds requested. \
**Learning** - Use Dework Templates instead of duplicating tasks \
**Learning** - Do not assign task points to Dework templates \
**Insight** - There is no point in changing Dework tasks moved to done. Most of them are already rewarded \
**Insight** - Some Workgroups use a bad date format that requires manual updates from Treasury Guild. See previous Treasury Guild Video for correct formats: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dg9AotLULU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dg9AotLULU) \
**\[Decision]** - all Gamers Guild fund requests will have to be discussed before automatically rewarding \
**\[Decision]** - All Townhall video editing tasks by Fly will be held in backlog until further clarification \
**Insight** - Do not use dollar cents in Dework task names; instead round them to the whole number \
**\[Decision]** - We will allow each workgroup to have its own tool license costs, even if they are the same tools.&#x20;

#### **2) Treasury System Updates**&#x20;

**Description** - Sharing updates related to changes and new features to the Treasury System \
**Insight** - We have updated the Dashboard view on the live website: [https://treasuryguild.com/Singularity%20Net/Singularity%20Net%20Ambassador%20Wallet?tab=report](https://treasuryguild.com/Singularity%20Net/Singularity%20Net%20Ambassador%20Wallet?tab=report) \
**Insight** - If you use "Week Nr" in Task name it will convert the contribution date into the last date of the given week \
**Insight** - for a more detailed view and historical information we use the Power BI dashboard&#x20;

**3) Ambassador Program Dashboard Analysis**&#x20;

**Description** - We now have several different views to visualize our collective contributions \
**\[Decision]** - We will hold Incubation Guild's rewards until further discussions \
**\[Action]** - Change the total USD calculations in Power BI into total AGIX calculations\
**\[Action]** - Create a workgroup drill-down view similar to the Participants' view in Power BI\
**\[Action]** - Add total budgets and current status to the overview page for dashboards\
**Insight** - almost all workgroups and guilds are using USD indication to reward participants\
**Insight** - Almost all workgroups have increased their rewards to 20$ per hour or more\
**Insight** - Current operations are not sustainable and can not be continued as is \
**Insight** - Archives Workgroup rewards are not included in the Dashboard because they are sending fund requests quarterly&#x20;

#### **Next elegant steps** (general action items)&#x20;

We will continue discussing the next quarter's budget in the Discord Ambassadors Forum "Treasury budget Discussions".
