Themes:

Considerations:

* Are our current tools aligned with our values of privacy and decentralisation?
* How can we gather constructive feedback from all members?
* What incentives or recognition can we provide for contributions?

Next steps:

* Develop more (cybernetic) feedback loops for the Ambassador Program
* **\[Action]** Add anonymous feedback form to onboarding “getting started” with key info and contacts
* **\[Action]** Develop an AI ethics code from a grassroots perspective, for review by community - [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DOO2TKNkLBKSFFa5jvgAHm30wjNpRj0uXiVz6YRtI9E/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DOO2TKNkLBKSFFa5jvgAHm30wjNpRj0uXiVz6YRtI9E/edit)
