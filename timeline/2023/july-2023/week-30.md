#### Brief Summary:&#x20;

We began with an intro to Grace Rachmany: Grace has her mind in many various projects in the space: recently spearheading a DAO Leadership course and working on Priceless DAO. She's written ICO Whitepapers, has a wide ranging blog on sites like Medium and Mirror, and videos on Odyssee. [https://gracerachmany.com/](https://gracerachmany.com/)&#x20;

The first question was on scaling programs to which the reply was why are teams getting bigger? "What's all the bigness about?"&#x20;

The topic moved into reputation of a person and how there's all these additive ways to add reputation but hardly ever ways to take away reputation. This brought us into topics of roles and leadership where there needs to be some way to manage the program. Great points around how would you demote someone? What is the appeals process? For example: could there be a minimum threshold of people appealing that someone needs removed from the program before it goes to some sort of vote or decision? We discussed ways to prove or provide levels of participation/reputation with the examples of a dojo and belts which would be hierarchical based on who is a master. Other categories could work like having 5 categories with various levels within those categories. A category could be AI knowledge - maybe you're level 1 or 2 there and a 5 in a different category.

How do we automate processes? Discussion came up about how one poisonous person can destroy a community without an anatomical structure to correct the situation. Sociocracy was brought up a few times and Grace mentioned exercises we could do: see [https://www.sociocracyforall.org/](https://www.sociocracyforall.org/)&#x20;

The importance of KPI's. How we need to get to the root of the problems, steps for identifying problems. When things are difficult we need the ability to challenge/remove/sit and hash things out. See meeting recording  on YouTube in coming days.
