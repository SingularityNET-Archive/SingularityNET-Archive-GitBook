#### **Agenda Items**&#x20;

#### **1) Housekeeping**&#x20;

**Description** - We went through the facilitators who were assigned to the preparation of the meeting and the tasks assigned to them, and also went through the facilitation rotation that who will be preparing for the next meeting and its tasks.

#### **2) Onboarding processes**&#x20;

**Insight -** The onboarding process for new community members is essential for their effective integration into the workgroup. Creating a step-by-step guide ("A Program") will provide clear instructions and guidance, making it easier for newcomers to get acquainted with the workgroup's activities. \
**Learning -** By implementing "A Program," the workgroup expects to see improved efficiency in onboarding new members and a reduction in the time taken for them to become active contributors.&#x20;

#### **3) Listing/Availability of tasks**&#x20;

**Insight -** Improved visibility of available tasks within the workgroup space is crucial for facilitating collaboration and encouraging members to engage in relevant projects. \
**Learning -** By listing all the assets that workgroups deliver, members will have a comprehensive view of available tasks, enabling them to choose tasks aligned with their skills and interests more effectively.&#x20;

#### **4) Next elegant steps** (general action items)&#x20;

The workgroup will take a break for two weeks.

#### Attendees:&#x20;

cran, fly, headelf, peter, waka, chris, slysyl&#x20;

#### Agenda Items:&#x20;

Meeting with Grace Rachmany&#x20;

#### Length of Meeting:&#x20;

1 hr&#x20;

#### Goal and/or Action Items:&#x20;

Ask questions to Grace Rachmany and bring up topics to help the Ambassador Program move forward.&#x20;

#### Brief Summary:&#x20;

We began with an intro to Grace Rachmany: Grace has her mind in many various projects in the space: recently spearheading a DAO Leadership course and working on Priceless DAO. She's written ICO Whitepapers, has a wide ranging blog on sites like Medium and Mirror, and videos on Odyssee. [https://gracerachmany.com/](https://gracerachmany.com/)&#x20;

The first question was on scaling programs to which the reply was why are teams getting bigger? "What's all the bigness about?"&#x20;

The topic moved into reputation of a person and how there's all these additive ways to add reputation but hardly ever ways to take away reputation. This brought us into topics of roles and leadership where there needs to be some way to manage the program. Great points around how would you demote someone? What is the appeals process? For example: could there be a minimum threshold of people appealing that someone needs removed from the program before it goes to some sort of vote or decision? We discussed ways to prove or provide levels of participation/reputation with the examples of a dojo and belts which would be hierarchical based on who is a master. Other categories could work like having 5 categories with various levels within those categories. A category could be AI knowledge - maybe you're level 1 or 2 there and a 5 in a different category.

How do we automate processes? Discussion came up about how one poisonous person can destroy a community without an anatomical structure to correct the situation. Sociocracy was brought up a few times and Grace mentioned exercises we could do: see [https://www.sociocracyforall.org/](https://www.sociocracyforall.org/)&#x20;

The importance of KPI's. How we need to get to the root of the problems, steps for identifying problems. When things are difficult we need the ability to challenge/remove/sit and hash things out. See meeting recording  on YouTube in coming days.

### <mark style="color:green;">Strategy Guild</mark>

#### Agenda :&#x20;

What's in the Ambassador name and stages of Ambassadors

#### Present:&#x20;

Headelf (host), Fly (co-host), Cran(co-host), Peter, Chris, Waka, SlySi, Tevo

#### Length:&#x20;

Approx 45 minutes. This meeting was after a lengthy Incubation meeting with special guest Grace Rakmany so we started late.

#### Discussion:&#x20;

Headelf filled in on previous meetings about the name, rankings, path and some confusion of how to become an “Ambassador”. Previous meetings came up with names of Lurkers (not yet engaged); New-bee (newly engaged); Trusted; Work Group Lead; Leadership (role at roundtable?). Lengthy discussion followed with Chris and WaKa having solid input on some of the names. Peter, Fly and Tevo expressed concerns on some of the labels and stages that had previously surfaced.

It was decided that “Lurker” was not a warm name and perhaps Explorer would be better. Chris suggested an old Europe use of names ie. Initiate, Apprentice, Journeyman(person), Master. It was also brought up (WaKa maybe?) about Grace's use of belt colors as used in martial arts : white, yellow, orange and black. This will need more community input and discussion, thought it was almost agreed on via a light consensus type discussion that there are four formal “Ambassador: classes starting with New-bees. Oh this name was not particularly liked but until we decide on one I will continue to use. To this farmer in a bee hive the New bees usually come with spring and the revival of life after winter.

The conversation pivoted to what does it take to become an ambassador. Waka commented that there was too much between stage 2 (trusted or newbee?) and stage 3 (trusted and WG lead?) where someone could begin to get paid. It was agreed after some convo that a formal request needed to be put in by an applicant. Not complicated but it ensures the person wants the position and they are cognizant of the process.

**NOTE:** Headelf had to leave the meeting due to a previous date (engagement) so anything discussed after this (see below) is an addendum from other participants.

Avoid naming the participation types and levels in ways that are offensive or patronizing, like Lurker or n00b. We should assume a new member perspective, and use terminology that maps for them the trajectory of meaningful growth in their participation lifecycle. Thus, Explorer or Prospect for recent arrivals.

Levels structured around leadership and management of org entities \[Guilds / WG] is limiting and does not promote recognition of non-management contributions and subject area expertise.

Best avoid framing the levels based on Discord roles, permissions, or validation steps.

Terms like Member, Participant, Contributor may have additional implications and should be used selectively and consistently. For example, Participant vs. Contributor may imply eligibility for compensation. Member \[of an organization or a legal entity] may have jurisdiction-specific statutory implications.
