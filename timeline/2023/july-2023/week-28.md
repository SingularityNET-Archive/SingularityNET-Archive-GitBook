#### Goals and/or Action Items:&#x20;

* Onboarding WG will send out emails to remaining interested people in the program
* Incubation WG will work on a Fund Request / Proposal, field feedback for these topics&#x20;

**Summary:**&#x20;

**1) Onboarding:** email follow-up where some solutions were one-on-one outreach via Discord, more open and casual sessions (game night, informal meetups). Onboarding will work towards emailing remaining interested people. We discussed having at least one monthly scheduled meeting that's structured around onboarding. Onboarding meets bi-weekly, Thursdays @ 1pm UTC. Town Hall pre-party event is still 30min before Town Hall every Tuesday @ 6pm UTC&#x20;

**2) Eszter's Swae proposal** (Research project on organizational life-logging/organizational memory, which was initiated in a conversation with Eszter and David Orban) and began answering some of the questions: [https://proposals.deepfunding.ai/collaborate/03853891-57b6-454f-98c2-8242d48ebb3e](https://proposals.deepfunding.ai/collaborate/03853891-57b6-454f-98c2-8242d48ebb3e)&#x20;

**3) Fund requests / proposal for Incubation**. Conclusion is for work groups to just go ahead and experiment which we will work towards.&#x20;

4\) Eszter came in for the final hour. **Discussion on LLMs** mainly (Felix) and light discussion on Eszter's Swae proposal .
