# Week 29

## Monday 17th July 2023 <a href="#docs-internal-guid-8e213b4f-7fff-d387-55df-f0c5b230e7fe" id="docs-internal-guid-8e213b4f-7fff-d387-55df-f0c5b230e7fe"></a>

### Education Guild

#### Attended by:

Peter, Syntronyx, and TheFreysDefi.

#### Summary

The meeting opened up with Peter and Alex discussing the excellent work done by Alex on creating an education course using google apis.

Thefreysdefi joined and discussed his absence and reasoning. He also thanked the community for stepping up in his absence. Many thanks.

Alex created a short course – short in usage time, but lengthy in development – to begin what could end up turning into SingularityNet University.

The discussion then turned to how to build out this concept into an ecosystem-wide initiative. This type of education format could be used to create learning modules for all ecosystem partners and projects. We also discussed using this method to help with onboarding users to the Snet marketplace both as consumers and creators.&#x20;

There was discussion on incentivitization for users after testing, but we hit a roadblock on how that would work as not to be gamified.&#x20;

Discussion went further into adoption of the Snet platfform by educational institutions and governments. This touched on The Department of Education and how to get in front of decision makers. We discussed the various departments, grant funding, and The Office of Technology Education that helps foster technology usage within education. This was a lengthy discussion

We went on to discuss how we would appropriately build out this initiative and what steps would need to be taken next. We settled on the need for a deepfunding proposal and discussed how it would be proper to proceed further, how funds should be appropriately used, and what is deemed proper for an ambassador guild funds request.

We agreed a project or creation of “something” would be needed to facilitate our goals. Peter recused himself from being a part of any deepfunding proposals as he is an employee. He did however support the idea. We also discussed involving other ambassadors.

It’s agreed further steps are needed to plan this out.&#x20;
