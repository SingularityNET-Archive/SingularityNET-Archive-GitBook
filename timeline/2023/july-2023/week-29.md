# Week 29

## Monday 17th July 2023 <a href="#docs-internal-guid-8e213b4f-7fff-d387-55df-f0c5b230e7fe" id="docs-internal-guid-8e213b4f-7fff-d387-55df-f0c5b230e7fe"></a>

### <mark style="color:red;">Education Guild</mark>

#### Attended by:

Peter, Syntronyx, and TheFreysDefi.

#### Summary:

The meeting opened up with Peter and Alex discussing the excellent work done by Alex on creating an education course using google apis.

Thefreysdefi joined and discussed his absence and reasoning. He also thanked the community for stepping up in his absence. Many thanks.

Alex created a short course – short in usage time, but lengthy in development – to begin what could end up turning into SingularityNet University.

The discussion then turned to how to build out this concept into an ecosystem-wide initiative. This type of education format could be used to create learning modules for all ecosystem partners and projects. We also discussed using this method to help with onboarding users to the Snet marketplace both as consumers and creators.&#x20;

There was discussion on incentivitization for users after testing, but we hit a roadblock on how that would work as not to be gamified.&#x20;

Discussion went further into adoption of the Snet platfform by educational institutions and governments. This touched on The Department of Education and how to get in front of decision makers. We discussed the various departments, grant funding, and The Office of Technology Education that helps foster technology usage within education. This was a lengthy discussion

We went on to discuss how we would appropriately build out this initiative and what steps would need to be taken next. We settled on the need for a deepfunding proposal and discussed how it would be proper to proceed further, how funds should be appropriately used, and what is deemed proper for an ambassador guild funds request.

We agreed a project or creation of “something” would be needed to facilitate our goals. Peter recused himself from being a part of any deepfunding proposals as he is an employee. He did however support the idea. We also discussed involving other ambassadors.

It’s agreed further steps are needed to plan this out.&#x20;

#### Agenda Items:&#x20;

#### 1) What are the processes to record who is contributing to the Governance Framework doc?&#x20;

How can we improve the process? How should we display our problem (or other) statements? What platform?&#x20;

Don’t bring people to governance - take governance to people.Use the tools that people like and are familiar with.

What is our change process; how do we support continued evolution? Are we expecting fixed, finished documents that people can only read and not change? In this decentralised space maybe our governance documents need to be much more fluid - which would have a big effect on our governance, since most of us are used to the idea that “governance” does involve quite fixed things? &#x20;

**Decision:** on the Governance GitBook, we have listed key issues from the Governance Framework document, and a link to a Google Doc for each one where people can discuss and comment without needing to grapple with Git.

\
**ACTION:** We will post GitBook link in Discord [https://catalyst-swarm.gitbook.io/snet-ambassador-governance-framework/](https://catalyst-swarm.gitbook.io/snet-ambassador-governance-framework/), explain what we are inviting people to do, and ask people to contribute their thoughts via the linked Google docs

#### 2) Planning an event to discuss the most-commented issues in the Governance Framework doc

**ACTION:** Felix, Stephen, Slate, and Vani will get together to plan an event with breakouts to discuss the different topics in the Governance framework doc&#x20;

#### 3) Experimentation process in sNET, and recording a Governance baseline

See [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pORhk41M5sSHn6drCxoynEaDgVK5ITfcCgEFpS1aBw0/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pORhk41M5sSHn6drCxoynEaDgVK5ITfcCgEFpS1aBw0/edit?usp=sharing)

* Why are we building governance and who is it for? Is it a product?
* Language of governance for chains is often derived from public policy - idea of a “digital nation” - but reflecting on CIP-1694 shows that people use CORPORATE governance as a model.
* How do we frame change as an experiment? We need to be collecting experimental data on how well a change worked, i.e. ask stakeholders what effect it had on them. There’s also ethics around people’s informaed consent to be part of the “experiment”.
* Is “problem and solution” structure worth questioning too? It’s not an asset-based approach to focus on what is wrong - sometimes need to focus on what is good and how to amplify it. Also it falsely sugests that “problem and solution” are a matched pair, when actually there are many solutions to a problem, and which one you pursue can be political, or driven by resources, etc.

**ACTION:** Contact Eszter re: the “governance baseline” issues that we were discussing in the 16th June meeting.

#### Next steps:

We have done quite a lot of thinking and planning and structuring; we have the info on Gitbook and the associated Google docs…\
now, we need to focus on making sure people know about it and can join in.

### <mark style="color:red;">Process Modelling Workgroup</mark>

#### **Context:**&#x20;

Workgroup lifecycle: the processes of establishing or maintaining workgroups to serve the community

#### **Meeting notes:**&#x20;

#### **Video Summary:**&#x20;

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/SKuLImviit0" %}

#### **Agenda Items**&#x20;

#### **1) Housekeeping**&#x20;

**Description -** Discussed practicalities of Miro-based task management for meeting rhythms \
**Learning -** it's difficult to do task management simply by making sticky notes in miro - layout makes a big difference in understanding. We continue trying to communicate direction and intuition for meeting-preppers that will result in clear responsibilities and understanding of needed meeting-related activities and how to do second-level task-management.\
**Decision -** Iterated "housekeeping" area to clarify "this-meeting" tasks vs "next-meeting" tasks, and handoffs between responsible contributors week to week. \
**Description:** when prospective members don't do their parts, our workgroup doesn't work \
**Insight -** prospective members can't gain active status except by actively contributing \
**Insight -** reinforced need for developing some engagement flow for prospective members&#x20;

#### **2) Reviewed Workgroup model**&#x20;

**Description -** We focused discussion on the Seed workgroup - how a workgroup gets started and becomes adopted to its larger organization \
**Insight -** a workgroup should have a purpose clearly connected to its org's mission/strategy/gaps/pain-points \
**Insight -** Important to have feedback on workgroups - esp. if there is a budget - so it can continue, refine itself, stop itself or continue separately from the org. \
**Decision -** Recommend periodic **check of purpose and impact and budget** based on Workgroup activity/results \
**Insight** - We're developing a lightweight framework for workgroup lifecycles, leaving things flexible for people to act with autonomy while connecting their intent to impact on org-level needs.&#x20;

#### **3)Next elegant steps** (general action items)&#x20;

**Action -** Next Week: evaluate workgroup & program strategy / formation elements - same as Seed Group?? \
**Action -** Next: adopting metrics and impact measurements for different types of workgroups.
