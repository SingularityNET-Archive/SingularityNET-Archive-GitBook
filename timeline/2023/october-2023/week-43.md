## Tuesday 17th October 2023

### <mark style="color:green;">Governance WorkGroup</mark>

(Note: this summary covers both 17th and 24th Oct 2023)

#### People Present:

Kenric, Peter, Rojo, Fly, Headelf, Felix \[documenter]

#### Purpose:

This Workgroup focuses on topics around Governance systems and processes at the SingularityNET Ambassadors program

#### Summary:

In the Meetings on October 17th and October 24th, we discussed and ideated on a process to use the SNET Ambassadors Contribution and Treasury systems to define an onchain voting system based on a "one-person-one-vote" test vote on the Cardano Blockchain:

More information at: Meeting Notes: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h\_KtaPZxV977x3Mxa7T4ta-ivcxXbgmOYetAT3seDw8/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h_KtaPZxV977x3Mxa7T4ta-ivcxXbgmOYetAT3seDw8/edit?usp=sharing)

#### Detail

This process outlines a first PoC of one-person-one-vote decision making process within the SingularityNET Ambassadors program.

**How it actually works**

1\) Ambassador Program participants contribute\
2\) Contributions are tracked via Dework/GitHub tasks\
3\) Contribution tasks are uploaded into treasury system\
4\) Treasury system transforms participations into onchain data (Transactions)

This process allows us to “validate” individual contributors over an open-ended time frame and the longer an contributor engages, the stronger his identity gets. This finally introduces a process which is able to replace a KYC process, bootstrapping a new way of “Proof Of Livelihood” while in the meantime ensuring a high level of anonymity as the only identifiers used are a Discord handle and a Wallet Address on the Cardano Blockchain. As this process provides a verifiable list of contributors, each linked to one specific wallet, we have plenty of interesting opportunities to pilot decision making processes based on “one-person-one-vote” at a Blockchain protocol level.

To achieve the “one-person-one-vote”, we whitelist the program's contributors, generate a list of eligible wallets and send one voting token to each contributor. In this first pilot, we will use the [Voteaire Platform](https://voteaire.io/), which allows voting processes on the Cardano Blockchain.

(There are multiple other platforms and solutions to run an on-chain voting process on the Cardano Blockchain; we use Voteaire due to its easy interface)

The Voting Ballot will allow only holders of the Voting token to cast their votes, through the policy id of the token.

#### Voting Eligibility parameters

At this first pilot, we defined some very simple parameters on how to “select” eligible voters. These soft parameters can be easily changed and adjusted in further initiatives.

**Individuals are eligible if:**\
&#xNAN;**-** Minimum 5hrs tracked contribution in the Program\
\- Active for a minimum of 6 months in the Program

Token policy id - 3bbbc9facd9611c1f72521245c2ef3e72e6d580b11ad767a6584d045 (edited)\
Token fingerprint - asset1eg7jp22f7qtczjj2da9nk65g6f49qkqtll93ku\
Token Name: SNet test token\
Token Amount: 51

**What do we want to measure**\
Voting participation % ([51 Total eligible voters](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h7nWb3_yPbabxnQNUEkMSh7GeV2oRfi4RFShDwSOuj0/edit#gid=0))

#### Action Items:

* Bootstrap the PoC as a initial test vote
* Define voting start and end dates
* Create Voting Guide material
* Set up voting ballot on Voteaire
* Announce voting at Ambassador Town Hall, 31st Oct
* Send voting test token to contributors

### <mark style="color:green;">Onboarding Workgroup</mark>

#### People present: <a href="#docs-internal-guid-69ade962-7fff-6410-17f1-bdf519993d6d" id="docs-internal-guid-69ade962-7fff-6410-17f1-bdf519993d6d"></a>

Sucre n Spice \[facilitator]; Vani \[documenter]; Hogan Tuso; Peter; Lord Kizzy

#### In this meeting we discussed:

New Onboarding email\
Video of the 7th Sept Onboarding meeting\
Whether the Onboarding WG should be presented as a “1st port of call” for new people\
Q4 budget and costing our work\
The value of hidden work\
The importance of 1-2-1 engagement work, of the kind that Sucre does\
The problem of people doing tasks for rewards only\
Flat rate payments, vs payment per engagement, vs payment per task, vs payment per hour

#### Decisions:

* new Onboarding email [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dFfexScth-EyoKW1dhoCrsAz53E131YGXJykDPB-aBE/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dFfexScth-EyoKW1dhoCrsAz53E131YGXJykDPB-aBE/edit?usp=sharing) - Step 2 should not be “attend all meetings” - instead, highlight a) Ambassadors TH, and b) Onboarding WG.\
  **Rationale** - New people might have opinions on onboarding, and might find it easy to engage in the WG.
* We will pay people to comment in discussion docs: $10 per doc that you contribute to (not per contribution). At the end of the quarter, assess whether people are commenting purely for the reward.
* $200 per month to Sucre for direct onboarding work, (DMs, explaining things individually).\
  **Rationale:** we recognised the value of this mostly-invisible work - 2 people in the meeting said how much it had helped them. Without it, people often don’t get properly onboarded.

#### Action items:

* Sucre to tweak Onboarding email and send out by next week
* Vani to meet LadyTempestt and LordKizzy re: meeting documentation by next week
* All to try to attend Treasury meeting later today

#### Learning points:

* Payment-per-contribution may cause people to add low-value input purely to get the reward. But worth the risk, to avoid micromanagement, and minimise overhead in assessing who gets paid.
* There is more to pricing a task than how long it takes. Special skills or knowledge; how essential the work is; how demanding it is (e.g. being constantly “on call”) can affect what is a fair price.
* 1-2-1 onboarding work: long term, Sucre could perhaps train more people to do it, but for now she can manage it.

#### Things to carry over for next meeting:

none

## Friday 20th October 2023

### Writers' Workgroup

Present:

Kenichi \[facilitator], Mikasa, Peter, Slate, Judith, CjFrankie \[documenter], Devon Hardy, Emmanuel Issac, Lord Kizzy, LadyTempestt.

#### Agenda:

\- Substack Newsletter\
\- Looking forward into the month of November\
\- Zealy update\
\- General

#### Kickoff

The writer’s work group session kicked off very strong as Kenichi introduced the newest set of Scribblers — congratulations to Judith Williams and Emmanuel Issac for achieving this milestone; they are now a full-blown Scribbler as they can now pick up tasks on Dework board. Kenichi also added that all the Scribblers should fill out the Scribbler onboarding form [https://tinyurl.com/4zpyxatz](https://tinyurl.com/4zpyxatz) to enable us to grow exponentially.

#### Substack Newsletter

The idea of the Substack Newsletter was raised by Kenichi. According to him, our focus is to swiftly send out monthly updates covering everything around the Ambassador program. The aim of disbursing these newsletters is to keep everyone informed and updated on upcoming events likely to occur in the following months.

Peter raised comments about the Substack newsletter and he concluded that the idea should be implemented.

**\[action]** Following that, Kenichi added that he would create a dework task for the Substack newsletter  —  everyone should be on the lookout.

#### Looking forward to the month of November

November still has a lot more in the bag for Scribblers!

Firstly, the need for October templates has arisen. There will be specific tasks covering that aspect plus, while setting up the writers' work group Substack page, atomic essays would be going out too.

\
For the sake of clarity, Kenichi briefly explained what an atomic essay is all about — according to him, these essays are write-ups of around 200–400 words. They will contain relevant links with at least 1–2 minute reads. The atomic essays would also be accompanied by infographics and thankfully, some scribblers showed interest.

#### ELI5 — Explain Like I’m 5 Years Old (Threads)

Kenichi also raised comments regarding ELI5 articles; they will be written as Twitter threads in simple English so everyone can understand (there will also be infographic designs for this task). Scribblers should keep an eye on the Dework task board.

#### Zealy update

We know that community engagement and growth have been at the forefront of the writers' work group. We want to see the SingularityNET Ambassador program grow exponentially. To this effect, we saw that Zealy would be an effective tool.\
With Zealy, we could get more engagements for our Twitter, Medium, and also Discord. With the help of contests, surveys, and quizzes (web3 niches) we would be able to push new engagements that will bootstrap the SingularityNET Ambassador program.

Should in case you have any idea on how this milestone can be reached, kindly reach out to Kenichi — your ideas and suggestions will be welcomed with open arms.

And that brings us to:

#### General

Kenichi expressed his joy and commended everyone on the call for the support shown on the Ambassadors' Medium account. He said that there has been a big difference from when we started until now; currently, we have 38 subscribers and we’re looking to amass over 60 subscribers by the end of this quarter.

Mikasa suggested that members of the workgroup should also pay attention to the Medium publications; each member is advised to read these articles and give at least 30 claps after reading, as this act could trigger the medium algorithm and SNET would reach more audiences.

We also had our editing setting session where Scribbers read and edit an article for better clarification.

Great Meeting!!!
