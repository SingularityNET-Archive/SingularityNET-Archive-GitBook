### <mark style="color:green;">Governance WorkGroup</mark>

(Note: this summary covers both 17th and 24th Oct 2023)

#### People Present:&#x20;

Kenric, Peter, Rojo, Fly, Headelf, Felix \[documenter]

#### Purpose:&#x20;

This Workgroup focuses on topics around Governance systems and processes at the SingularityNET Ambassadors program&#x20;

#### Summary:

In the Meetings on October 17th and October 24th, we discussed and ideated on a process to use the SNET Ambassadors Contribution and Treasury systems to define an onchain voting system based on a "one-person-one-vote" test vote on the Cardano Blockchain:&#x20;

More information at: Meeting Notes: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h\_KtaPZxV977x3Mxa7T4ta-ivcxXbgmOYetAT3seDw8/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h\_KtaPZxV977x3Mxa7T4ta-ivcxXbgmOYetAT3seDw8/edit?usp=sharing)&#x20;

#### Detail

This process outlines a first PoC of one-person-one-vote decision making process within the SingularityNET Ambassadors program.

**How it actually works**

1\) Ambassador Program participants contribute\
2\) Contributions are tracked via Dework/GitHub tasks\
3\) Contribution tasks are uploaded into treasury system\
4\) Treasury system transforms participations into onchain data (Transactions)

This process allows us to “validate” individual contributors over an open-ended time frame and the longer an contributor engages, the stronger his identity gets. This finally introduces a process which is able to replace a KYC process, bootstrapping a new way of “Proof Of Livelihood” while in the meantime ensuring a high level of anonymity as the only identifiers used are a Discord handle and a Wallet Address on the Cardano Blockchain. As this process provides a verifiable list of contributors, each linked to one specific wallet, we have plenty of interesting opportunities to pilot decision making processes based on “one-person-one-vote” at a Blockchain protocol level.

To achieve the “one-person-one-vote”, we whitelist the program's contributors, generate a list of eligible wallets and send one voting token to each contributor. In this first pilot, we will use the [Voteaire Platform](https://voteaire.io/), which allows voting processes on the Cardano Blockchain.&#x20;

(There are multiple other platforms and solutions to run an on-chain voting process on the Cardano Blockchain; we use Voteaire due to its easy interface)

The Voting Ballot will allow only holders of the Voting token to cast their votes, through the policy id of the token.

#### Voting Eligibility parameters

At this first pilot, we defined some very simple parameters on how to “select” eligible voters. These soft parameters can be easily changed and adjusted in further initiatives.

**Individuals are eligible if:**\
&#x20;**-** Minimum 5hrs tracked contribution in the Program \
&#x20;\- Active for a minimum of 6 months in the Program

Token policy id - 3bbbc9facd9611c1f72521245c2ef3e72e6d580b11ad767a6584d045 (edited)\
Token fingerprint - asset1eg7jp22f7qtczjj2da9nk65g6f49qkqtll93ku\
Token Name: SNet test token\
Token Amount: 51

**What do we want to measure**\
Voting participation % ([51 Total eligible voters](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h7nWb3\_yPbabxnQNUEkMSh7GeV2oRfi4RFShDwSOuj0/edit#gid=0))

#### Action Items:&#x20;

* Bootstrap the PoC as a initial test vote
* Define voting start and end dates
* Create Voting Guide material
* Set up voting ballot on Voteaire
* Announce voting at Ambassador Town Hall, 31st Oct
* Send voting test token to contributors

#### **Agenda items:**

#### **1) Review Edited Lessons**&#x20;

**\[Decision]** The project Method Lesson is now good enough \
\[**Action]** Wallet Registration Lesson Method 1 to be updated - Sucren 08.11.23&#x20;

#### **2) Review new Draft lessons**&#x20;

**\[Decision]** Instead of Git pull request lessons we make it easier and use commits \
**\[Decision]** We drop the Swarm Treasury Integration Lesson. It does not serve a purpose in Dework PBL \
**\[Action]** Address session feedback into GitLab Commit Lesson - Andre 08.11.23&#x20;

#### **3) Other Lesson related topics**&#x20;

**\[Decision]** We unassigned Permission Lesson drafting from Peter. It's open for someone else to be drafted \
**\[Decision]** We create a Custom Task Management Features lesson \
**\[Decision]** We combine contributions lessons into one, where PBL feedback will also include new lesson suggestions \
**\[Action]** Draft Custom Task Management Features lesson - Tevo 08.11.23 \
**\[Action]** Draft Course Feedback lesson - Tevo 08.11.23 \
**Discussion Points** instead of integrating Swarm Treasury System, let's describe the configuration features Swarm Treasury System has configurations that address some Dework limitations&#x20;

#### **3) Action ideas for lessons**&#x20;

**\[Decision]** Specializing Lessons do not require action items and instead these are used as additional resources \
**\[Action]** Change the Background Knowledge Lessons order to match with student activity flow - Andre 08.11.23 \
**Discussion Points** We combine several onboarding lessons with a few activities to gather basic input from students \
Going through BBK lessons will guide the student through creating a task in their own space to reward themselves \
We will continue refining activities next session&#x20;

#### **Keywords**&#x20;

**Topics:** Activities, students, PBL, Dework, Miro Board, Lessons, Git, Andamio \
**Sources:** Project Method Lesson - [https://andamio-andamiojs-starter-lms-git-governance-g-1b84f0-gimbalabs.vercel.app/course/module/301/3012](https://andamio-andamiojs-starter-lms-git-governance-g-1b84f0-gimbalabs.vercel.app/course/module/301/3012) Gitlab Commit Lesson - [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wubKgjua2JOeEboDqjNbOUQJmjTlALeSiJbDC4LQgFE/edit#heading=h.pqdvjt7i0rpe](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wubKgjua2JOeEboDqjNbOUQJmjTlALeSiJbDC4LQgFE/edit#heading=h.pqdvjt7i0rpe) **Feelings:** This was an amazing lesson where we were able to go through a lot of new and improved content that we produced over the weeks.

Peter \[host], Sucre n Spice \[co-host ], Love \[documenter], Vani , Kevin, Mayor, Nwobi.

#### In this meeting we discussed:

&#x20;\- A summary of what was discussed from the previous onboarding meeting.\
&#x20;\- The 7th September recording from a video WG member.\
&#x20;\- Turning the “getting started doc” into a Twitter thread.\
&#x20;\- The “welcome video” to the SNET ambassador program.\
&#x20;\- Approach to putting tasks on Dework\
&#x20;\- The requirement for one to join the onboarding group and contribute to a document in a meeting.&#x20;

#### Decisions:

**\[Decision]** New members that attend up to  3 meetings in a month or 5 meetings in a quarter can  be given the onboarding team member tag/role. This role does not come with monetary benefits but would be able to directly apply for tasks in Dework. \
**\[Decision]** ask LilyCupcake if she's up for making more of a “timeless” intro/welcome  video for the ambassador program.

#### Action items:&#x20;

**\[Action]** Video WG should be able to get the 7th Sept. Recording and clips done by Monday- Sucre n Spice\
**\[Action]** Draft a list of what info a WG needs to give to the Video WG when commissioning them to make a video : Vani to create then share with Rojo

#### Learning points:

&#x20;\- We need to tell video WG what kind of clips we need, and be more specific(i.e.minutes, style, etc).\
&#x20;\- We should give tasks according to the person’s role in Discord to curb low-quality cont

#### To carry over for next meeting:&#x20;

**Continuous onboarding:** Based on  [Onboarding WG - how can we support other WGs to onboard new people in their meetings](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fYx3CXgT-NGi19TmBUxS3lTMu93Hx68cpGST8TED9cA/edit?usp=sharing) - what actions do we want to take to support onboarding across other WGs?
