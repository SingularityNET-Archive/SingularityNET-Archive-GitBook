* Consider non-profit / steward ownership / other organisation models
* Join for the social mission and values
* Take inspiration from cypherpunk manifestos and hacker ethos

### Process Modelling Workgroup

### Incubation Guild

### Strategy Guild

## Thursday 12th October 2023

### <mark style="color:green;">Onboarding Workgroup</mark>

#### Present:  <a href="#docs-internal-guid-d23e5535-7fff-a8aa-50ac-228b2953f9d8" id="docs-internal-guid-d23e5535-7fff-a8aa-50ac-228b2953f9d8"></a>

Sucre n Spice \[facilitator]; Vani \[documenter]; Peter; LadyTempestt; LordKizzy; Tevo

#### Minutes of last meeting:&#x20;

Agreed as a correct record

#### Action items from last meeting: &#x20;

* No, the recording of 7th Sept onboarding session is not yet on Youtube; been over a month now. Do we still want clips made? **\[Decision]** Yes, we still want clips if possible, but the priority is getting video up.  \[ACTION] Sucre will chase it; hopefully will be up before next meeting.
* Couple of new ideas in [Onboarding WG - how can we support other WGs to onboard new people in their meetings](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fYx3CXgT-NGi19TmBUxS3lTMu93Hx68cpGST8TED9cA/edit?usp=sharing) **\[Decision]** We’ll discuss whole issue in a future meeting; and there is enough to discuss, so only add more if you have a really genius idea.

#### Agenda

#### 1) Quick check of [Getting Started doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q4dhediWgcbgAP3Wfsky\_-roVyfCUe6xi-dhBdHbU4s/edit?usp=sharing) -&#x20;

No new comments have been added

RE: asking Social Media team to e.g. tweet an invite link to Getting Started channel, with “If you’re curious how to become an sNET ambassador...”? \[Decision] Better to do it as a tweet thread; but we didn’t decide who will progress this.

New people are applying to be ambassadors - \[Action] Sucre to tweak the onboarding email so it matches what we now have in #GettingStarted, and send it out to them. Discussion of best Discord link to get them to #Getting Started? \[Action] Peter to try to work out best link

#### 2) Introducing meeting summary templates from Archives WG&#x20;

* Before the meeting, Sucre and Vani decided on the Minimalist template; will probably add action and decision items as a customisation.&#x20;
* LadyTempestt agreed to try minuting using this template, starting next meeting.&#x20;
* **\[Action]** LadyTempestt and Vani to meet before next Onboarding meeting to customise the template.

#### 3) Payment structures and how we pay for work in this WG

Continuing the discussion from last session. See: [SNET Onboarding WG Task Reward Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1mwFPPabzXLixDG\_LkKvFp5tRER30sxT\_wGV3ySt-MZ4/edit), [Onboarding Workgroup | Dework](https://app.dework.xyz/singularitynet-ambas/onboarding-workgroup), and [Contribution-Based Budgeting Model](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZQA9xOyKFoiOgzI9ED9pExPIWs62tH9i\_r\_CSib6S-k/edit?usp=sharing) - a new idea for a model fromTevo

* We agreed on a price for documentation. Same approach as facilitation - more for first timers, to reward stepping up; and a little to someone to offer mentorship for first timers.
* Discussed but not agreed - quality control for documentation.
* We agreed that document creation (i.e. making discussion docs for people to contribute to) will probably be c. 8hrs a month. $20 per doc suggested. Still to discuss what people should be paid for contributing to a doc - and is it a flat rate, a price per contribution, or something to do with perceived “quality” of contribution? There’s also a few other tasks to discuss and price.
* Question: Are we trying to move towards price per task, or do we want a price per time or per contribution? Tevo’s Contribution model \*can\* work with any of these, although it does enforce “price-per-hour thinking”. How we price things might vary depending what it is.
* Question: Contribution model says “Calculate the percentage of the total time spent by each member in relation to the overall time contributed by all members.” - is this across whole program, or each WG? Depends whether WGs have their own budgets or not.
* Sucre: advocates WGs having a definite budget per WG, and if they go over, they can’t dip in again. The meeting largely agreed, tho didn’t come to a definite resolution - further discussion next week.
* Question: in Q3 review sessions it’s been suggested that a WG’s budget will be based on what it spent last quarter? Should this be the case? since the scope of a WG’s work might change since then? Or should it be based on a projection, based on what they plan to do this quarter? Or something else?
* Do we as a WG need to work out our idea of what we think we will spend in total in Q4, or not? General agreement that yes, we should continue to go through [SNET Onboarding WG Task Reward Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1mwFPPabzXLixDG\_LkKvFp5tRER30sxT\_wGV3ySt-MZ4/edit) and price the tasks, and discuss what work we think we’ll do overall this quarter, to try to arrive at a projection. Noted that this will cover regular tasks and one-offs, which may be harder to predict - so need contingency money?
* Program-wide budget discussions will continue in Treasury Guild and in Q3 assessment sessions; final decision will be in TH.

**\[Decision]** - we’ll continue the process of pricing our tasks in next week’s meeting

**\[Action]** - members of this WG will try to attend Treasury/ Q3 assessment sessions.
