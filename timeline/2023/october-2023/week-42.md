#### People present:  <a href="#docs-internal-guid-69ade962-7fff-6410-17f1-bdf519993d6d" id="docs-internal-guid-69ade962-7fff-6410-17f1-bdf519993d6d"></a>

Sucre n Spice \[facilitator]; Vani \[documenter]; Hogan Tuso; Peter; Lord Kizzy

#### In this meeting we discussed:&#x20;

New Onboarding email \
Video of the 7th Sept Onboarding meeting\
Whether the Onboarding WG should be presented as a “1st port of call” for new people\
Q4 budget and costing our work\
The value of hidden work\
The importance of 1-2-1 engagement work, of the kind that Sucre does\
The problem of people doing tasks for rewards only\
Flat rate payments, vs payment per engagement, vs payment per task, vs payment per hour

#### Decisions:

* new Onboarding email [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dFfexScth-EyoKW1dhoCrsAz53E131YGXJykDPB-aBE/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dFfexScth-EyoKW1dhoCrsAz53E131YGXJykDPB-aBE/edit?usp=sharing)  - Step 2 should not be “attend all meetings” - instead, highlight a) Ambassadors TH, and b) Onboarding WG.  \
  **Rationale** - New people might have opinions on onboarding, and might find it easy to engage in the WG.
* We will pay people to comment in discussion docs: $10 per doc that you contribute to (not per contribution). At the end of the quarter, assess whether people are commenting purely for the reward.&#x20;
* $200 per month to Sucre for direct onboarding work, (DMs, explaining things individually). \
  **Rationale:** we recognised the value of this mostly-invisible work - 2 people in the meeting said how much it had helped them. Without it, people often don’t get properly onboarded.&#x20;

#### Action items:&#x20;

* Sucre to tweak Onboarding email and send out by next week
* Vani to meet LadyTempestt and LordKizzy re: meeting documentation by next week
* All to try to attend Treasury meeting later today

#### Learning points:&#x20;

* Payment-per-contribution may cause people to add low-value input purely to get the reward. But worth the risk, to avoid micromanagement, and minimise overhead in assessing who gets paid.
* There is more to pricing a task than how long it takes. Special skills or knowledge; how essential the work is; how demanding it is (e.g. being constantly “on call”) can affect what is a fair price.
* 1-2-1 onboarding work: long term, Sucre could perhaps train more people to do it, but for now she can manage it.

#### Things to carry over for next meeting: &#x20;

none
