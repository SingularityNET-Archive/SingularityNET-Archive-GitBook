#### Attending:&#x20;

PsychonautGuy, Tevo, Fly, Headelf \[host]

#### Meeting length

1 hour due to hard stop.

#### Summary notes

Convo began on Leadership and its meaning. \
Tevo indicated Leadership is an individual trait and it is not used enough. \
Fly thought it is an abstract form. \
Consensus after a more in depth convo was that term “Leader” is acceptable. \
\
Regarding ethics itself, Tevo stated first rule sb “Do no Harm” in line with medical ethics. \
Questions arose including: How is that implemented. Headelf thought that “Be Nice” should cover most social ethics. Other thoughts included: Show Respect; Equity; Fairness; Equality but more. More in depth convo ensued and waxed philosophical but with an inclusion of reality. \
Notes or highlife soundbites include: Speak the truth; Do unto others…; Create a Good Leader Guide; Be a nice person.&#x20;
