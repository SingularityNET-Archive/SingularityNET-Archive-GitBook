Kenichi \[Workgroup Lead] \[facilitator], Slate \[documenter], Mikasa, Devon, Sucre n Spice, Godspower Vixor, Folem Perssy, Sid&#x20;

#### Summary:&#x20;

The Writers Workgroup convened on August 11th, 2023, with a diverse attendance including familiar faces and newcomers. Kenichi, the Workgroup Lead, dedicated the final 15 minutes of the call to acquaint the new members with the group's activities and processes.

A significant point of discussion was the postponement of the contribution system agenda to the following week.&#x20;

Kenichi guided Slate in the creation of a thread focusing on AI and beyond, which is scheduled for finalization and discussion in the upcoming Thursday meeting.

Kenichi provided an update to Mikasa regarding her thread.

**\[decision]** The decision was made to publish the ”Introduction to the Ambassador Program” on Mindplex. \
**\[decision]** Slate's article on “Synthesis of Arts and Altruism” was deemed ready for publication on Mindplex after finalization.

The Mindplex account's readiness was confirmed, and members were encouraged to explore a newly posted article on Medium: [Towards a Benevolent Singularity: Exploring Humanoid Robots and AGI's Impact on Society](https://medium.com/@singularitynetambassadors/towards-a-benevolent-singularity-exploring-humanoid-robots-and-agis-impact-on-society-a276e4d5546d).

**\[action item]** A critical task assigned was the writing of an article on “Deep funding round 3”, to be undertaken by Kenichi due to its urgent nature.&#x20;

Slate's meeting summary notes were successfully added to the board.

Mikasa is actively engaged in working on a recurring thread centred around “SingularityNet news”.&#x20;

The meeting included a warm welcome from Kenichi to new members, during which he provided a comprehensive orientation to the group's processes and ongoing initiatives.

For those seeking to participate actively, the acquisition of the Scribbler tag is essential to access the Writers' Workgroup's Discord channel. Newcomers are required to take the new test, available here: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/119vvftlF8IVEo-82kq3Fyq559WZwlgAeAej8SX43\_uE/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/119vvftlF8IVEo-82kq3Fyq559WZwlgAeAej8SX43\_uE/edit) and they were also guided to take help from the editing framework open here [https://www.notion.so/Editing-Framework-1b6da3afa3624c328382414f39511acc?pvs=4](https://www.notion.so/Editing-Framework-1b6da3afa3624c328382414f39511acc?pvs=4)

Kenichi highlighted the progression pathway within the group, starting from the Scribe role, followed by Scribbler, and ultimately Editor, as experience accumulates. The role of a scribe involves overseeing article quality and publication, with a focus on burden-sharing and topic suggestions.

To clarify processes, Kenichi addressed questions from Godspower, providing a concise overview. Any Scribbler is welcome to suggest article topics backed by research. A task is assigned upon approval, and a deadline is set for submission.

**\[action item]** Devon contributed by suggesting an article idea, to be presented once he conducts further research by Monday.&#x20;

The meeting ended with a comprehensive understanding of ongoing projects and the anticipation of upcoming discussions.
