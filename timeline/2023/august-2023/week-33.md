#### Topic & Agenda :&#x20;

Code of Ethics for SNET Ambassador Cadre.&#x20;

#### Meeting length

2.25 hours.

#### Present:&#x20;

Walter aka WaKa; Kenric; Iain; Psychonaut Guy; Rojo; Sucre n Spice; Mayor Defi; Devon Hardy; Mickylala; Headelf \[Facilitator].

#### Narrative

A wide ranging, passionate and civil conversation was held. It was part of the meeting and Guild ground rules that all participants respect all others, no hand raising needed but also no speaking over another speaker.\
Headelf rambled on about the Ambassador Program, direction, past and the reasons for looking into a code of ethics. Kenric stated that pushback on the term “Leadership”in a decentralized organisation is difficult and there was a need to maintain the term. Rojo did not have an issue with the term or the word or the image. His background is a “leader" is chosen by the people to serve and the opposite is called a dictator. \
**\[ACTION]:** Rojo suggested a definition of the term “Leader” be laid down. There are many cultures and prejudices involved so an agreeable definition may be good.

Kenric stated four roles were required in a meeting (continued discussion on leader): 1. Facilitator - runs the meeting and makes the agenda; 2. Secretary - takes notes and minutes and documents; 3; Representative- an elected position to represent the constituency; 4. Leader - elected with a side note that an effective leader is one who serves.\
WaKa indicated the organization needs a unified vision. More possibly than stated on the Snet website. Tom indicated that with unity out of debate and diversity requires ethics and civility.

Rojo cited the American constitution and their checks and balances system. He indicated the need for it in Snet and had the thought that if you receive money or rewards the individual must be accountable. \
**\[ACTION]:** A monthly or quarterly meeting on a longer then normal call for all WG and Guild Leaders to present what has been accomplished and to let the community be involved in the checks and balances system.

WaKa brought up that we (Snet ambassadors) are part of a larger organization and we need to fit in. He questioned about the Foundation about how they view us.\
Iain had some very insightful comments on the Foundation but more on his view about the Ambassador Program with two observations or questions: \
1\. What is effective? \
2\. Why is the Ambassadors Program a good idea? \
In five simple words he summed it as “To get the word out”! More convo followed and one takeaway for me (Headelf) was the concept that the Foundation (or him/ not certain on the ideation) wanted the Ambassadors to have an intangible definition and that our role should be self-defined. Ambassador education is an important item. Accepting change and questioning if a particular guild is not of value.\
The convo was circled back to the agenda item of ethics. It was a consensus topic that ethics should be mostly common sense of base civility. Things that go against these ethics should be handled by somebody in some fashion. There was a long convo about this but the consensus was to draw up a doc which Sucre n Spice suggested be pinned to the Discord. The base or starting point for the doc is to be a scraping of Discord room rules. |\
**\[ACTION]:** headelf to draw up a doc based on Discord rules. It was agreed this Ethics doc needs to be concise.

Headelf brought up the next question of what should occur if someone violates an ethics principle. A very spirited discussion ensued. Rojo and/or Sucre n Spice initiated the idea that a violation should initiate a call to have a “nice” conversation and possible resulting after all sides were heard in a first warning. A second violation would bring a consequence. More spirited discussion held about what the consequence should be. Expulsion was most mentioned but no consensus was reached, and this was tabled until the initial doc of ethics was drafted, though it was reached consensually that the individual being addressed for an ethics violation could and would have the right to object.\
It was brought up that a definition is needed for Guild leadership and that this thought needs further ideation. We should focus on a worst case scenario and focus on Guild leadership.\
It was suggested and agreed that a group/body above the guilds is needed. Iain brought up a simple but profound concept that with an ethical statement - no one is above the law. It is needed to make certain leadership is distributed and that no one in leadership gets off, since if one is let off, the system would be worthless.\
**\[ACTION]:** a need to have a wider convo about this with the Ambassadors.

It was suggested by Psyconaut Guy that the issue could be part of an NFT and regulated by a smart contract. A 51% vector was mentioned after which the Net would be burned. Kenric thought it needed to be a unanimous consent and not a vote. He brought up the concept and principles of Sociocracy For All - www.sociocracyforall.org . He indicated it should be held within the guild system. But what if wider than Guild (worst case scenario) was brought up. He indicated this needed to be considered a Judicial action and like a trial by peers needs to be unanimous.\
Iain brought up that the key word in this action is Consensus. He suggested a range of actions such as a 30 day time-out for an out of character outburst, etc.\
There was a convo around required margin for a judicial action such as we were discussing. The range was from 51%, 2/3s to unanimous. If there were a close friendship for alliance the person should/could excuse themself.\
This was a two hour ten minute meeting. We had several action items, thinking to do and further discussion next Wednesday at Strategy.

#### Action items

1. ”Leader” - define the term for Snet use.
2. A regular (monthly/quarterly) meeting for Guilds to justify their budget and production.
3. Headelf to start a concise ethics doc based on a combo of Discord channel rules.
4. Initiate a wider Ambassador conversation on this initiative.
