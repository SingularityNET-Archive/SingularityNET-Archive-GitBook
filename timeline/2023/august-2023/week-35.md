Ethics continued

#### Location:

Discord voice

#### Attending:

PsychonautGuy, Tevo, Fly, Headelf \[host]

#### Meeting length

1 hour due to hard stop.

#### Summary notes

Convo began on Leadership and its meaning.\
Tevo indicated Leadership is an individual trait and it is not used enough.\
Fly thought it is an abstract form.\
Consensus after a more in depth convo was that term “Leader” is acceptable.\
\
Regarding ethics itself, Tevo stated first rule sb “Do no Harm” in line with medical ethics.\
Questions arose including: How is that implemented. Headelf thought that “Be Nice” should cover most social ethics. Other thoughts included: Show Respect; Equity; Fairness; Equality but more. More in depth convo ensued and waxed philosophical but with an inclusion of reality.\
Notes or highlife soundbites include: Speak the truth; Do unto others…; Create a Good Leader Guide; Be a nice person.
