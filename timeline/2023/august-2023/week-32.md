#### Miro Board

See [https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVM5jyehQ=/?moveToWidget=3458764560782272677\&cot=14](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVM5jyehQ=/?moveToWidget=3458764560782272677\&cot=14)

#### Agenda

#### **1) Go through Action items from last meeting**

**\[ACTION]** Vani and Sucre to tweak the email and then post a new version in Discord for comments **(done)**\
&#xNAN;**\[ACTION]** Vani and Sucre to include a suggestion on how to phrase what the process is to be formally accepted as an Ambassador in the new draft of the Onboarding email. All to comment.\
&#xNAN;**\[ACTION]** Once the new Onboarding email text is agreed, Peter will share his list of 300-ish people with Sucre so they can be contacted. **(done)**\
&#xNAN;**\[ACTION]** when emails go out, they will be BCCd\
&#xNAN;**\[ACTION]** Name of the “Ambassadors Only” meeting changed on calendar to “leadership session”, for clarity **(done)**\
&#xNAN;**\[ACTION]** We will give a heads-up to WG and Guild leads that new prospective Ambassadors might attend their meetings, and they should be welcomed.\

&#xNAN;**\[ACTION]** We will meet again on 3rd August and see how it feels to meet weekly **(done)**\
&#xNAN;**\[ACTION]** Vani to liaise with Tevo re access to account to be able to start meetings **(done)**

#### 2) Onboarding email - ready to send?

Yes, except for\
1\) adding a link to Instagram at the end\
2\) wording the “You applied a while ago” line at the start, so we can add it to those for whom it’s relevant\
3\) sorting out the Dework task about sign up to Dework and adding a wallet - it shouldn’t ask people to DM Felix, etc\
&#xNAN;**\[ACTION]** Sucre (and Vani if needed) to fix these things then it can go out

#### 3) One-to-one contacting - how’s it going?

Not enough time to discuss

#### 4) Ensuring new people get a warm welcome

* Was mentioned last meeting that new people are not always feeling welcomed.
* Part of it could be fear that someone unknown who turns up in a Zoom meeting is a spammer. Should we circulate a list of the Zoom names of new people, so WG leads can keep an eye out for them?
* Or do WG leads need a bit of training or ideas on how to welcome new people? (e.g. saying Hi rather than just ignoring)
