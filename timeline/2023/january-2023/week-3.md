#### Town Hall Summary:
Alessandro's Presentation of ZRush
Topic: Progress on drone swarm project for 3D mapping and metaverse applications

Key Points:
Developed a design for controlling the drones and displaying a 2D map view.
Struggling to create a real-time 3D reconstruction due to processing power limitations.
3D reconstruction might be feasible for post-processing captured images.
Potential applications include agriculture, event recording (post-facto), and metaverse object rendering.
Ken's Presentation

Topic: Development of adaptive learning AI for the CarX Capture Unit metaverse training module
Key Points:
Building a recommendation engine to suggest questions to students based on their performance.
The engine will consider factors like question complexity, student's answer history, and learning topic.
Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques will be used to analyze question complexity.
Initial focus is on multiple-choice questions but may expand to handle more open ended responses.
Considering using sentiment analysis of lecture text to guide avatar instructor's tone.
The recommendation engine and logic are designed to be generic for broader applicability.
Discussion Points
Potential collaboration with a partner in the educational sphere for the adaptive learning engine.
Combining the 3D mapping technology with existing satellite image data for improved metaverse object creation.
Exploring ways to represent complex operations within the metaverse training module (e.g., animation of machine processes).
