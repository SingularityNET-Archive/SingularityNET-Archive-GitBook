#### Town Hall Summary:
This Community Governance meeting focused on brainstorming the frequency and format of different governance meetings within a community. 
Key points including 
Current Meetings:
Bi-weekly Governance Calls
Bi-weekly Team Meetings (recorded, with separate recorded and unrecorded parts)
Town Halls (on an ad-hoc basis)

Challenges:
Low attendance at Team Meetings
Difficulty in knowing what content is best for Town Halls vs. Team Meetings

Proposed Solutions:
Merge Team Meetings and Town Halls into a public forum
Teams give 5-minute presentations at the beginning
Depending on attendance, use breakout rooms or have a central discussion
Higher frequency Town Halls
Consider keeping a separate, less frequent Team Meeting for confidential discussions
Important Points
The discussion aimed to improve the effectiveness of communication within the community.
There is a desire to increase participation in meetings.
Finding the right balance between informative presentations and open discussions is a challenge.
