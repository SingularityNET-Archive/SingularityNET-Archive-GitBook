**Insight -** a good way to discuss and coordinate\
**Insight -** silly to vote on things that are already done\
**Learning -** Starting from checking the most aligned immediate tasks and delegating tasks helps us to prioritize activities\
**Learning -** Priority also depends on capacity\
**Insight -** Agendas and tasks should have some basic requirements to be able to determine the urgency for discussion

#### **Agenda Items**

#### **Feedback from Writers workgroup**

We aren't here to force process change ... but instead, to model existing process ... plus small recommended refinements based on our experience and best practices.\
**Goal**: client workgroups are engaged in the modeled processes\
**Dework Action** - get feedback from Writers Workgroup

#### **Candidate workgroups for process modeling**

**Governance workgroup?**\
**Decision:** That group is still a bit early; not yet fully formed

**Process workgroup?** we can model our own processes prefer to take external processes at higher priority\
**Decision**: defer

**Quarterly Ambassador Budget creation process?**\
That activity is still in progress Want to address soon, while the experience and learnings are still fresh in minds.\
**Decision**: likely next priority

**Modeling Workgroup-formation process?**\
not a working group per se, but... we can provide one or more models that a working group can follow to achieve effective formation possible that different types of workgroups can have different processes e.g. Writers workgroup vs Governance workgroup\
**Decision**: This will be our current priority.\
**Insight:** meta analysis can be useful

**Learning**

**Administrative** Today's meeting not prepared well. Miro frame needs to be ready in meeting board! ...along with other checklist items\
**Dework Action**: Update task templates for prep and summary activities
