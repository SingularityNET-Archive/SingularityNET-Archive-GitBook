#### **Agenda Items**&#x20;

**1) Tested ABCD + F to-do list model**&#x20;

**Description -** A new model to help us organize tasks \
**Decision -** We continue using ABCF + F model for future prioritizations\
**Action -** Include a different process to differentiate done tasks before adding them to voting \
**Insight -** a good way to discuss and coordinate \
**Insight -** silly to vote on things that are already done \
**Learning -** Starting from checking the most aligned immediate tasks and delegating tasks helps us to prioritize activities \
**Learning -** Priority also depends on capacity \
**Insight -** Agendas and tasks should have some basic requirements to be able to determine the urgency for discussion&#x20;

#### **2) Live vote demo of Summon platform**&#x20;

**Description -** testing DAO tools to engage participants and contributors in decision-making models \
**Decision -** We discontinue testing and using the Summon platform \
**Action -** Try different platforms for decision making \
**Insight -** It's not an open source to improve our use cases \
**Learning -** can't export data effectively \
**Learning -** Confusing user experience&#x20;

#### **3) Next elegant steps** (general action items)&#x20;

Reorganize Ambassador tasks to new view to include latest learnings\

#### **Video Summary:**&#x20;

Video\_Summary TBD&#x20;

#### **Agenda Items**&#x20;

#### **Feedback from Writers workgroup**&#x20;

We aren't here to force process change ... but instead, to model existing process ... plus small recommended refinements based on our experience and best practices.\
**Goal**: client workgroups are engaged in the modeled processes \
**Dework Action** - get feedback from Writers Workgroup&#x20;

#### **Candidate workgroups for process modeling**&#x20;

**Governance workgroup?**\
**Decision:** That group is still a bit early; not yet fully formed&#x20;

**Process workgroup?** we can model our own processes prefer to take external processes at higher priority \
**Decision**: defer&#x20;

**Quarterly Ambassador Budget creation process?** \
That activity is still in progress Want to address soon, while the experience and learnings are still fresh in minds. \
**Decision**: likely next priority&#x20;

**Modeling Workgroup-formation process?** \
not a working group per se, but... we can provide one or more models that a working group can follow to achieve effective formation possible that different types of workgroups can have different processes e.g. Writers workgroup vs Governance workgroup \
**Decision**: This will be our current priority. \
**Insight:** meta analysis can be useful&#x20;

**Learning**&#x20;

**Administrative** Today's meeting not prepared well. Miro frame needs to be ready in meeting board! ...along with other checklist items \
**Dework Action**: Update task templates for prep and summary activities&#x20;

#### **Next elegant steps** (general action items)&#x20;

@Slate will arrange meeting board and other prep activities for next week's meeting.
