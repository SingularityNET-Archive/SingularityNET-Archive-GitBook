**Dework task:** [link](https://app.dework.xyz/singularitynet-ambas/gov-wg?taskId=809975d7-c4ce-468a-aafc-05ef9690d8ed)

We discussed the idea of facilitating peer education sessions focused on governance. Opinions differed on whether this fell within the purview of the Governance WG, with some arguing that the Education WG should handle such tasks. A counterpoint raised was the potential value of knowledge sharing on specific governance-related topics, which might encourage broader engagement.

The WG is open to the idea, but it remains unclear where such sessions would take place. Participants proposed various formats, including debates, info-sharing sessions, and others. The group agreed on creating a task to explore content selection and determine the format and venue of the sessions. This task will be open for a week for interested individuals to sign up.

Further we gave some updates on the initial Governance Framework document which is currently being cleaned up. As the cleaned up version still is a quite massive paper with over 20 pages, we discussed the option of setting up a process We could invite people to engage - NOT add new insights, but just mark the parts that they feel are not essential, and should be deleted. ( + Create a guide on how we’d like people to interact with this draft - i.e. if someone marks a passage for deletion and you agree, just comment that you agree )

#### Action items:

* A task will be created to explore the idea of peer education sessions, specifically around "ocracies".
* A second task will be created, focusing on identifying parts of the Governance Framework document that could be removed.
* To be further discussed: Individual Dework tasks will be created from the 11 “comments” issues in the Governance document. However, no agreement was reached on who will handle this task due to time constraints so we would still need to elaborate on the thing.
