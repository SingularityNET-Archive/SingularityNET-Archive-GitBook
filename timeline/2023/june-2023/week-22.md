(Slide 4 to 7)

#### Host(s):&#x20;

Felix & Vanessa

Swarm Treasury team went thru Dework tasks and moved finished ones to “in review” A small team of 3 did some work on rewards algorithm in DeepFunding - experimental way of working using a small sprint team, it worked quite well. Created follow-up tasks for the Governance doc: writing a version 1.1, (JP will do it, which will also onboard him) and categorising/clustering the comments (see doc in the task here )&#x20;

Felix had call w Jeremy Pitt from Imperial College London: he has 3 PhD students who might be interested in collabs Also had call w Mihaela Ulieru Task to create supervisory council proposals is live also task to create Governance round proposals Meeting admin - e.g. invites, agenda template and slide deck - have been created

Felix set up a Miro to visualise the Governance doc Stephen, Vanessa and Felix are drafting a Governance WG proposal, inspired a bit by the rchives WG approach There is a doc aimed at developing Governance learning, to collate info on “governance knowledge” - all to add to it https://docs.google.com/document/d/119Yi8lhR-fuXuStqHqWvM-ZypQQe1dBwZfitWapXTkQ/edit?usp=sharing Joining call today is also an open task - will be assigned retrospectively

#### Issues:&#x20;

Having 2 rounds open simultaneously that are both to do with governance - how can we make it clearer to people?

How best to facilitate community engagement with Governance? There can be barriers. Governance affects whole ecosystem, but it needs a high level of knowledge

Do you have to be a specialist - maybe yes on some things, and maybe people don’t have time to deep-dive on everything - so we deep dive, and share what we found?

Can we include both “deep dive” topics and ones that people might find more accessible?

Incorporate material on decision-making methods that Process Guild has been doing? “Decision-making methods” could be a good starting point for governance discussion?

There is already governance happening in the community - maybe this workgroup identifies and crystallises that? “Look - you’re doing governance there!” and think about how to develop it? “Bottom up”, unlike how governance work usually is

No voting method or decision-making process is perfect, so variety is important. For example: Kenric’s doc suggests constitutional committee should be consent based, and dReps move to quadratic voting model

Cardano’s CIP-1694 is designed to centralise under a plutocracy. It’s not a first step to decentralisation. We’re being asked to buy into something that is not positive; and it’s not being made clear what it is

We need hypotheses, not implementations anything on governance needs to be framed as a proposal not an ideology we need to see the thinking behind governance changes, so people know what they are. we need to discuss alternatives to the things that are proposed, e.g. constitutional committee we need to define a hypothesis, and collect data to falsify or prove the “experiment”

More exploration on the idea of meritocracy? Governance is sticky - we are worried that one system, once introduced, will stay. Could we develop some little hypotheses on different governance frameworks, and small groups could investigate them? Create some bounties for starting these discussions?

We could use Dework’s functionality of upvoting - the most upvoted will become tasks (altho this embeds voting as a practice - that’s a governance system, so we shd be aware we are doing it)

### Process Guild

Meeting Summary Context:&#x20;

We Prioritize critical Ambassador Activities and cover process changes Meeting notes: https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVO0WVUBA=/?moveToWidget=3458764555273787315\&cot=10

#### Agenda Items&#x20;

#### Vote on decision making method for top decisions needed to be made in Ambassador Program&#x20;

* **Description** - How do we do decisions in Ambassador Program, what methods and models we could help us?&#x20;
* **Action** - each guild creates their own hypothesis on a decision making methods they use or are using&#x20;
* **Decision** - we will gather more knowledge and educate each other on different decision making models in the next Governance Workgroup sessions

#### Process Modelling Workgroup updates&#x20;

* **Description** - This workgroup is Establishing or maintaining processes to help community members to efficiently collaborate together&#x20;
* **Decision** - We start analyzing Writing Workgroup onboarding instead of Ambassador Program onboarding&#x20;
* **Learning** - Ambassador role currently is a leadership position that would require knowledge of leading workgroups

#### Comment on Archival proposal&#x20;

* **Description** - Action to review and feedback give feedback to Archival Workgroup&#x20;
* **Proposal Learning** - Participants were unaware of this Dework task when its only posted in meeting Summary as action, shared in Process Guild meeting and listed on Miro Board
* **Decision** - Will introduce new parameter 'Dework Action', for future Dework task derived from Process Guild meetings

#### Process Guild new process to navigate between meeting notes&#x20;

* **Description** - Alternative method to make easier to read meeting notes and make sense of discussions and its evolution, the downsides are loss of accuracy which date discussions took place&#x20;
* **Decision** - This method will not be used to so it will be easier to archive and have a time trail

Set Up Ambassadors Miro Account Description - Administrative task to give more freedom and access to Miro capabilities for Ambassadors Action - Buy License for ambassador account

Next elegant steps (general action items) Continue learning about decision making methods in the context of using them in Ambassador Program
