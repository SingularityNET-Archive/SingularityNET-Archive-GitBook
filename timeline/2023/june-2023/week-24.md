### Governance Workgroup Call: Experiment Framework Initiative

#### Present:

David Orban , Ester Galfalvi, Felix Weber

#### Recap:&#x20;

Call this morning where we dove into the issue of missing frameworks and processes for experimentation within the SingularityNET Ecosystem. It seems like our main challenges are related to coordination amongst ecosystem entities and participants. In addition, we're coming up short on community capacity to effectively operate experimental infrastructure. On top of that, securing financial resources to support framework operations and coordination is proving to be a bit of a challenge too.

We found some common ground during our discussion on several points:

Yes indeed, we're seeing a noticeable void in frameworks and processes for "experimentation at Snet" ^^ It's crucial that our experimentations are thoroughly documented and archived, making information readily accessible for all interested parties While it's important to have frameworks and standards, they shouldn't be forced upon anyone. Instead, they should act as guides for successful experimentation We're all for borrowing great ideas! Let's look at other ecosystems, both within and outside of the DLT world to discover already existing frameworks and processes for conducting experiments, and glean what we can Any efforts towards brainstorming and implementing frameworks should be viewed as a collaborative team effort amongst SingularityNET entities and participants

Next Steps We'll kick-start a "Problem Statement" document. The idea here is to clearly define our current issues and to pinpoint the critical questions that we need to address before we dive into solution mode.&#x20;
