#### **Agenda Items**&#x20;

**1) Closing down Action items from "To be Archived" lane**&#x20;

**Description** - in previous week we identified Agendas, actions and tasks that could be archived. Selected completed items to give brief updates on the results and outcomes \
**Decision -** No longer report completed items in Process Guild sessions\
**Decision -** Closed Items will be reported on the Meeting Summary as Decision Items \
**Decision -** Task to create a visual representation about Writers Workgroup onboarding model is completed \
**Decision -** Action to comment on Archival proposal is completed \
**Decision -** Task to Define frame / structure of Translation Guild is completed \
**Insight -** Miro Board should not be used to manage tasks that require change log auditability \
**Learning -** Notion has built in Project Management board and calendar\
**Question -** For items that have an strong archival sentiment from majority, should we also archive them without having to report them in on Process Guild session?&#x20;

#### **2) Vacation calendar**&#x20;

**Description -** How should we plan our recharging time? \
**Decision -** Use a calendar to identify breaks, and treat the calendar as a coordination tool \
**Action -** If you want to coordinate your recharge or busy times when you are not able to facilitate sessions, include your time on Miro Board calendar\
**Insight -** Calendar location [https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVM7ZVTSo=/?moveToWidget=3458764558094746024\&cot=10](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVM7ZVTSo=/?moveToWidget=3458764558094746024\&cot=10) \
**Insight -** we don't need to stop program its opportunity to change workshop leads&#x20;

#### **3) ABCD+F model Sentiment Analysis v2**&#x20;

**Description -** A new model to help us organize tasks \
**Decision -** There will be no more async Miro Board votes from Process Guild sessions \
**Insight -** We have randomly tested creating sentiment analysis votes for async purposes; the participation rate has never been more than 5% of voter participation in the call. \
**Learning -** some participants don't have the capacity to participate in sentiment analysis because they have been voting too often in recent activities.\
**Insight -** some task priorities change week to week. \
**Insight -** it is possible to get quite good sentiment from 3 people voting compared to 7 people voting, shows that Ambassador Program Process Guild participants are quite aligned on most immediate agendas that the program should discuss and act on&#x20;

#### **4) New Miro Board Hub for Ambassadors**&#x20;

**Description -** migrate Miro Board from Swarm Account to SingularityNET Ambassador Account \
**Decision -** The All Meetings board will be discontinued \
**Decision -** Each workgroup and guild can be listed as separate board under Miro Map \
**Decision -** All Boards are with edit access \
**Insight -** Favorite the main Miro Board for easier navigation [https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVM7pbrwc=/](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVM7pbrwc=/)

Discussion highlights included what the malleability of a Fund Request could be and how proposals fit into this outline. Seemed to be an agreeance that the simplified budget made sense although not everything is fully hashed out quite yet.&#x20;

**WG Leads Draft:** [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DZK75HYvGKdhdj7TwO1EfPXrSwKfY7VVreeECToDh78/edit#heading=h.qh9qlksztg9p](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DZK75HYvGKdhdj7TwO1EfPXrSwKfY7VVreeECToDh78/edit#heading=h.qh9qlksztg9p) "The outlined text is not theoretical, rather looking back and simply identifies and formulates already existing knowledge, work and responsibilities which emerged though the previous monthsâ€¦. So, this document is more of an observation than a proposal as it does not introduce anything new to already observable items !"&#x20;

The Draft outlines what a WG/Guild Lead is, Observable Responsibilities, and How to become a Lead. Some conversation also happened around introducing Rejuve into the program.
