#### **Agenda Items**&#x20;

**1) Closing down Action items from "To be Archived" lane**&#x20;

**Description** - in previous week we identified Agendas, actions and tasks that could be archived. Selected completed items to give brief updates on the results and outcomes \
**Decision -** No longer report completed items in Process Guild sessions\
**Decision -** Closed Items will be reported on the Meeting Summary as Decision Items \
**Decision -** Task to create a visual representation about Writers Workgroup onboarding model is completed \
**Decision -** Action to comment on Archival proposal is completed \
**Decision -** Task to Define frame / structure of Translation Guild is completed \
**Insight -** Miro Board should not be used to manage tasks that require change log auditability \
**Learning -** Notion has built in Project Management board and calendar\
**Question -** For items that have an strong archival sentiment from majority, should we also archive them without having to report them in on Process Guild session?&#x20;

#### **2) Vacation calendar**&#x20;

**Description -** How should we plan our recharging time? \
**Decision -** Use a calendar to identify breaks, and treat the calendar as a coordination tool \
**Action -** If you want to coordinate your recharge or busy times when you are not able to facilitate sessions, include your time on Miro Board calendar\
**Insight -** Calendar location [https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVM7ZVTSo=/?moveToWidget=3458764558094746024\&cot=10](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVM7ZVTSo=/?moveToWidget=3458764558094746024\&cot=10) \
**Insight -** we don't need to stop program its opportunity to change workshop leads&#x20;

#### **3) ABCD+F model Sentiment Analysis v2**&#x20;

**Description -** A new model to help us organize tasks \
**Decision -** There will be no more async Miro Board votes from Process Guild sessions \
**Insight -** We have randomly tested creating sentiment analysis votes for async purposes; the participation rate has never been more than 5% of voter participation in the call. \
**Learning -** some participants don't have the capacity to participate in sentiment analysis because they have been voting too often in recent activities.\
**Insight -** some task priorities change week to week. \
**Insight -** it is possible to get quite good sentiment from 3 people voting compared to 7 people voting, shows that Ambassador Program Process Guild participants are quite aligned on most immediate agendas that the program should discuss and act on&#x20;

#### **4) New Miro Board Hub for Ambassadors**&#x20;

**Description -** migrate Miro Board from Swarm Account to SingularityNET Ambassador Account \
**Decision -** The All Meetings board will be discontinued \
**Decision -** Each workgroup and guild can be listed as separate board under Miro Map \
**Decision -** All Boards are with edit access \
**Insight -** Favorite the main Miro Board for easier navigation [https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVM7pbrwc=/](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVM7pbrwc=/)
