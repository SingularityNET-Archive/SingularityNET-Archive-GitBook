#### Town Hall Summary:
The meeting is focused on discussing the progress of different work groups and guild, such as:

Process Guild is working on a document that outlines the translation process, including interview questions, reward levels, and automatic calculators for translation tests. They are also considering how to account for fluctuations in the value of the AGIX token when assigning rewards.

Treasury Guild discussing how to spend the project's budget and determine how rewards will be distributed for different tasks. Members or anyone interested in this guild will meet bi-weekly or monthly, as needed.

Podcast WG Creating a podcast called "Stories from the Singularity." They are currently working on interviewing Gabriel Axel Montes and finalizing the design for the podcast's logo and banner. 

An important discussion point in this meeting is how to handle fees associated with managing the project's budget. There is a consensus that project members should not be responsible for covering these fees out of pocket.
