#### Town Hall Summary:
Kevin Chen presenting two governance proposals regarding SingularityNET's platform integration support for deep funding projects and voter eligibility in funding rounds. Important points are

Platform Integration Support Proposal:
Kevin proposes offering support for integrating deep funding projects into the SingularityNET Marketplace. He highlights concerns about the complexity of current integration processes and suggests creating support networks or expert groups to assist with seamless deployment. Discussion expands to potentially involving the community in onboarding processes, aligning with another proposal from Peter.

Voter Eligibility Proposal:
Kevin raises questions about voter eligibility in funding rounds, particularly whether proposers should be allowed to vote for their own projects. Concerns are discussed regarding the fairness and potential biases when proposers vote for their own projects. Suggestions include tracking voting behavior to identify and possibly discount or weight votes based on historical patterns or community engagement levels. Community 

Engagement and Reputation Systems:
There's a proposal to link voting weight with community engagement on the platform.
Ideas include rewarding active engagement with higher voting weights and possibly integrating reputation systems visible on user profiles to encourage constructive participation. The discussion touches on potential issues like manipulation of votes and the need for mechanisms to adjust and reset such systems over time.

Long-Term Governance Considerations:
Participants emphasize the importance of designing governance systems that can evolve and adapt over time without becoming locked into problematic structures. There's a preference for systems that allow adjustments based on community behavior and feedback rather than rigid rules. 

In summary, the conversation delves into improving platform accessibility for deep funding projects, ensuring fair voting practices, and exploring ways to integrate community engagement and reputation into governance processes. The focus is on flexibility, transparency, and community involvement in shaping SingularityNET's governance framework.
