#### Town Hall Summary:
The meeting is about updating progress on various work groups and discussing challenges with the podcast work group. The Process Guild meeting also discussed the translation and Gimbalabs tokens will be used to incentivize translators and reputation building.
The Process Guild made significant progress on the translation process and will do a full run through next week. The Treasury Guild meeting will take place on Thursday at 5:17 UTC. 
The Podcast WG meeting could not be held, due to scheduling issues. Julien is working on rescheduling the Podcast WG meeting for some time this week. There are delays in receiving Swarm funds, causing financial difficulties for the podcast project. The podcast project needs to pay for software but cannot currently afford the $30 monthly fee. Julian might need to use his own funds to cover podcast expenses until the next round of funding arrives.
