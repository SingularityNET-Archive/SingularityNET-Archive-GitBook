#### Town Hall Summary:
The meeting is about updating progress on various work groups and discussing challenges with the podcast work group. The Process Guild meeting also discussed the translation and Gimbalabs tokens will be used to incentivize translators and reputation building.
The Process Guild made significant progress on the translation process and will do a full run through next week. The Treasury Guild meeting will take place on Thursday at 5:17 UTC. 
The Podcast WG meeting could not be held, due to scheduling issues. Julien is working on rescheduling the Podcast WG meeting for some time this week. There are delays in receiving Swarm funds, causing financial difficulties for the podcast project. The podcast project needs to pay for software but cannot currently afford the $30 monthly fee. Julian might need to use his own funds to cover podcast expenses until the next round of funding arrives.

#### Town Hall Summary:
The community is discussing proposals for round two of the program.
Meeting key points:

-The program is an experiment in governance, reputation management, and incentivization.
-Deep Funding is a treasury that funds proposals to improve the Singularity platform.
-In round one, community members submitted proposals for how to improve Deep Funding.
-In round two, the community will vote on a shortlist of proposals to determine which ones will be implemented.

One proposal is to create a pool of rewards for onboarding existing AI services to the Singularity platform.
There are questions about how the rewards for onboarding existing services would be determined. Some ideas include:
A fixed amount for each service onboarded.
A separate pool for API readiness work.
Only rewarding developers for entirely new services, not existing ones.
