#### Town Hall Summary:
In Breakout Room 1,  we dove deep into the discussion of the different pools we should have. Should we add pools or keep the same pools we had in DFR3? What could we add? Should we keep the marketing pool or have marketing-related RFPs? Could we benefit from an education pool? 

In Breakout Room 2 we reviewed the current Deep Funding branding manual and guidelines. What areas can we improve? What brand voice do we want to use? How is the current branding perceived? Is it effective?
