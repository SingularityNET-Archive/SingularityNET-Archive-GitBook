Main Discussion: What would be the hourly rate of pay that we could use as a standard to calculate task estimates?

Overview: The Ambassador Program has a monthly budget of 62,500 AGIX (@\~$0.05/AGIX @ Today's Price = $3,125) which rolls over any unused tokens moving forward.

We have so far settled on $10/hr and in the video you'll be able to see our thought process in real time as we began the discussion at $40/hr and what that would look like for the program.

For example, our discussion of $40/hr would give us roughly 78hrs/month to work with ($3,125/40hrs) at today's AGIX price ($0.05/AGIX). We discussed that this number, depending on where you live, is multitudes more than minimum wage - and to allow enough budget for multiple work groups as well as tasks that the number would need to come down.

We discussed multiple prices leading towards $10/hr which we so far believe is a fair price that allows us to have enough budget to allow for multiple work groups, tasks, and encourage involvement.

On top of this discussion we are trying to figure out the best way to have consensus with the community on these ideas. Thoughts?

Note: Treasury Guild is recorded with bi-weekly meetings currently set to Thursdays @ 17UTC. In the #treasury-guild group and during Townhall updates every Tuesday @ 18UTC, on the SingularityNET Discord, we will provide an update, continue the conversation, as well as field any feedback, ideas, and opinions to bring to the next meeting. This is an evolving process and we plan to reassess any final decisions made on a quarterly basis along with the ability to revert any decisions based on feedback from the community by the time the following Treasury Guild meeting occurs.
