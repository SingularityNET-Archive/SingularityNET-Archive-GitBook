Main Discussion: What would be the hourly rate of pay that we could use as a standard to calculate task estimates?

Overview: The Ambassador Program has a monthly budget of 62,500 AGIX (@\~$0.05/AGIX @ Today's Price = $3,125) which rolls over any unused tokens moving forward.

We have so far settled on $10/hr and in the video you'll be able to see our thought process in real time as we began the discussion at $40/hr and what that would look like for the program.

For example, our discussion of $40/hr would give us roughly 78hrs/month to work with ($3,125/40hrs) at today's AGIX price ($0.05/AGIX). We discussed that this number, depending on where you live, is multitudes more than minimum wage - and to allow enough budget for multiple work groups as well as tasks that the number would need to come down.

We discussed multiple prices leading towards $10/hr which we so far believe is a fair price that allows us to have enough budget to allow for multiple work groups, tasks, and encourage involvement.

On top of this discussion we are trying to figure out the best way to have consensus with the community on these ideas. Thoughts?

Note: Treasury Guild is recorded with bi-weekly meetings currently set to Thursdays @ 17UTC. In the #treasury-guild group and during Townhall updates every Tuesday @ 18UTC, on the SingularityNET Discord, we will provide an update, continue the conversation, as well as field any feedback, ideas, and opinions to bring to the next meeting. This is an evolving process and we plan to reassess any final decisions made on a quarterly basis along with the ability to revert any decisions based on feedback from the community by the time the following Treasury Guild meeting occurs.

### Marketing Guild Meeting 1

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/sRqxB1hI68U" %}

Overview: We had a nice overview conversation starting with social media which pivoted into the broader scope of marketing.

Our discussion pondered posting educational content as well as updates about the Ambassador Program on various socials.

A piece of the conversation was Twitter with future possibilities including hosting or helping out with Spaces in the SingularityNET ecosystem.

We're looking for people interested in social media, video editing, writing, and content creation. All ideas are welcome.

To-Do / Goals:

* Post Ambassador Program updates to social media sites weekly beginning with Twitter and YouTube, while looking to branch out to Reddit, YouTube alternatives, etc.
* ponder a handle we would like to use across our socials and create an overall cohesiveness between socials

### Marketing Guild Meeting

Alright, Marketing Guild meets up today, Friday the 25th @ 13UTC. Bring your thoughts and ideas.

* Community Podcast meets at 14UTC right after if anyone wants to join.

Here's some notes / stuff to talk about:

Twitter unlocked as of yesterday and I changed the handle to @SNET\_Ambassador.

* Any thoughts on a better handle? We could use the same handle on the YouTube and other socials.
* Who is interested on being on the TweetDeck?

Weekly Townhall - anyone want to take over learning how to edit the video? We could add the same intro etc on all the videos we post.

Projects on the AI Marketplace could use write ups / blog posts / video content based around them.

Infographics about the ecosystem. A great starter would be an Ambassador Program flyer with our current schedule (ie Podcast, Townhall, Treasury, Marketing)

I wasn't able to attend the Treasury meeting this week due to holiday - we need to figure out our budget.

There's an interest form for the Ambassador Program. By Q1 2023 we should put together an email outlining some basic info, our schedule, and onboarding process to send out for the Ambassador Program.

To-Do: -Decide on a handle (or settle for SNET\_Ambassador) -Get Twitter going, find people that want to contribute, add to Tweetdeck, discuss posting guidelines -Weekly video editing and posting on the Ambassador YouTube -Plenty of potential for write ups, blogs, and videos on the ecosystem and Ambassador Program.
