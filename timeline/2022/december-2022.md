## December 9, 2022. Marketing Guild Meeting 4

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/qdOtAsMzD2E" %}

Overview: We now have a monthly budget allocation currently set to 7,500 AGIX per month.

During last week's discussion we chatted and worked on setting up Tasks on the Dework page. We've created a Marketing Guild section and have posted a few Tasks for those interested:

* Ambassador Weekly Meeting Infographic (up to 5 participants)
* Curate a Task
* Join the YouTube Editing Workshop

What we learned during the meeting was that some people would like more structured tasks within the Dework page. This is something Marketing Guild will work towards.

I encourage everyone to join the conversation within the Marketing Guild portion of the Ambassador Program within the SingularityNET Discord.
