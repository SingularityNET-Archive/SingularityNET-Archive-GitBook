## December 2 2022. Marketing Guild Meeting

Marketing Guild - Dec 2, 2022 (Meeting Fridays @ 13UTC)

We have a budget to start working with (up to 7.5K AGIX)

Potential Tasks: Video Editing (Weekly Townhall, Work Group Meetings) for the Ambassador YouTube

* utilize the Weekly Townhall editing guidelines (if someone would like to learn please let it be known)

Infographics - a nice starter would be an Ambassador Program flyer with our current schedule (ie Podcast, Townhall, Treasury, Marketing)

Profile Picture for Social Media (ie YouTube, Twitter) Banner for Social Media TweetDeck - Twitter post ideation / collaboration Writing: Plenty of potential for write ups from weekly to monthly updates on the Ambassador Program, AI Marketplace write ups, Deep Funding, SingularityNET Ecosystem & Spinoffs

Low Hanging Fruit: We could start posting the Weekly Townhalls onto the Ambassador YouTube

Begin posting on Twitter

Please add any ideas to the marketing-guild channel.

## December 9, 2022. Marketing Guild Meeting 4

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/qdOtAsMzD2E" %}

Overview: We now have a monthly budget allocation currently set to 7,500 AGIX per month.

During last week's discussion we chatted and worked on setting up Tasks on the Dework page. We've created a Marketing Guild section and have posted a few Tasks for those interested:

* Ambassador Weekly Meeting Infographic (up to 5 participants)
* Curate a Task
* Join the YouTube Editing Workshop

What we learned during the meeting was that some people would like more structured tasks within the Dework page. This is something Marketing Guild will work towards.

I encourage everyone to join the conversation within the Marketing Guild portion of the Ambassador Program within the SingularityNET Discord.
