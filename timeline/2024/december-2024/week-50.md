#### Narrative:
We discussed:
1. What are we trying to achieve by attending conferences? And what should we be doing there?
2. How does it get funded?
3. What kinds of events should we prioritise? (particular topics? virtual or IRL?) 
4. How should we make the decision on who goes where?
5. How do we track the outcomes?

On 1, we came up with a list of key aims (see "Decisions" below), and noted that these should influence what kinds of events we attend. We also discussed possible outputs: including the idea of short, vox-pop type videos on core questions about AI (similar to what was done in Panama). We noted that these could be shared on social media, and could help publicise sNET's ideas. We noted that, due to the lack of a robust consent process, such videos wouldn't be admissible as primary source material for BeGIN's research; but perhaps, if shared on social media, they could constitute secondary source material on people's opnions on AI-related questions.

On 2, 
- Esther noted that depending on the type of event, the Foundation might be willing to fund conference attendance sometimes
- We discussed whether and when Ambassador Program reserves should be used (see "decisions" below
- we suggested that perhaps there should be a cap/maximum per person that we should spend.
- other suggestions on funding were that "plus-1"s shouldnâ€™t be covered, nor should staying longer than the length of the conference, and if someone wants to return to a different airport than they departed from, this should only be permitted up to original costs of one-way.

On 3 and 4, we didn't decide definitely what types of event are most important; but suggestions included 
- a) Events that discuss decentralization, particularly in AI, but also in web3 communities as a whole
- b) Events that discuss AI and AGI 
- c) Events that discuss AI ethics issues (rather than events about business, or trade shows, etc)
- d) Virtual events, for "carbon footprint" and cost reasons; 
- e) Twitter spaces and similar, as well as major conferences 
- f) Events in places where we have a lot of people - for example, West Africa - or in places that we have regional focus (Latin America, Africa)
- g) Selection of who attends should be at least partly based on who is nearby, to minimise travel costs - but that this would have to be coupled with looking for events in places where we have a lot of people.
- h) We raised the issue of whether we could push for BGI-25 to be in an African country; but the location has already been almost selected for this year (still confidential), so perhaps we could lobby for an African location in 2026.

On 5, we noted that we should track results based on the specific event; we should set specific objectives based on our list of core reasons to attend (see "decisions" below); but we might want to steer away from rigidly quantitative KPIs, and focus more on an assessment of meaningful outcomes (For examplerather than counting how many people we speak to, attendees should try to give an honest assessment of how useful they thought it was). We noted that attendees might have a tendency to exaggerate the value of attending; and we discussed the need to make it possible to say "it wasn't useful" if it wasn't, and capture information from attendees on how we could make it better. We discussed asking attendees to write up a short summary evaluation of their attendance at an event (what went well, less well, what they learnt, how we can learn from any failures) which could be added to the Archives and referred to ahead of the next event. 
We agreed that the question of tracking results needs further discussion.

We noted that different WGs might take a lead on different aspects of planning, depending on the nature of an event.
We also mentioned the issue of how to decide who is able to (for example) represent the Ambassador Program at an event, and the possibility of mentorship to help people do this. (Twitter spaces could be a way to develop this.)




#### Decision Items:
- Agreed the main things we are trying to achieve will vary according to the details of the event; and are (in no particular order):
 
	1) Funnelling developers to DF (in collab with DF Developer Outreach Circle, ideally)
	2) Doing research interviewing for BeGIN Nexus
	3) Regional engagement (might mean we should prioritise events in Latin America and Africa?)
	4) Presenting on the stage about sNET
	5) Shouting about sNET's mission and vision!
  - [**rationale**] This list of objectives might change in the longer term, but for now it's the main things we can do effectively
  - [**opposing**] Not an opposing argument, but we noted that this list should influence what kinds of events we choose to attend.
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- RE how to fund event attendance, we agreed that a small "task force" (Peter, Guillermo, Vasu and Vani) will meet to ideate on when and in what circumstances we would use Ambassador Program reserves for conference attendance, and what process we should use to decide. We agreed that attending this meeting will be funded from the Governance WG budget.
  - [**rationale**] We agreed this will not be a decision-making group, but purely ideation, to put forward suggestions for others to comment on and develop (so, in effect, a consultative decision-making process). Funded from Governance because it is largely a Governance issue.
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- Types of events - we agreed that we should have a presence at core events organised by sNET itself, such as BGI-24 - but we should aim to attend at least one "non-sNET" event in 2025 - and that perhaps it should be something with a more "decelerationist" perspective.
  - [**rationale**] To ensure we're not only reaching those who are already on board with sNET's perspective.
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We agreed that regardless of the type of event, we need to plan ahead more.
  - [**rationale**]  e.g. to enable people to get visas; and to enable us to budget and prioritise across the whole year.
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We agreed that some kind of mentorship or shadowing process would be useful to help people feel able to represent sNET at events both virtual and IRL; we need to think further on how to do this and how to fund it.
  - [**rationale**] to build people's confidence that they know what to say, what issues to emphasise, how to respond to likely questions, etc.
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople

#### Action Items:
- [**action**] Small "task force" to meet later this week, and ideate on how to decide whether Ambassador reserves should be used to fund attendance at a conference [**assignee**] PeterE, osmium, guillermolucero, CallyFromAuron [**due**] 13 December 2024 [**status**] todo
