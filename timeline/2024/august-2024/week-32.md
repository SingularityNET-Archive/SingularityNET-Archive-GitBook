  - [AI Ethics GitHub board](https://github.com/orgs/SingularityNet-Ambassador-Program/projects/1/views/2)

#### Narrative:
We worked through the GitHub project board, starting with "In progress" items, then "To do"

Quick discussion of GitHub management, and how we process Issues where several people are paid different amounts (for now, might need to create separate issue for each person to dovetail with Treasury system)

Some issues remain about payment for the strategy-writing tasks, and how the money should be divided between each group; there have been comments outside of meetings about fairness. This raises wider questions for us as a WG on what is fair re: money and pay, and is part of our governance as a WG. (Examples: what happens if someone cannot do a task for reasons beyond their control, such as illness? What if someone drops out of a task? Or if work is done late? What if there's a team, and one person does more work than the others - and how do we determine what is "more work" - is it about time, capability, or something else?) So we agreed to discuss in general terms in our next meeting.

Quick discussion about reportbacks from WG to GEI meetings: Jenn is happy to just share her written reportback rather than actually talking to it in the GEI meeting.

AGI-24: roles are all assigned, and Vani will share info on meeting links, more exact role descriptions, templates for documentwers, etc in the next few days. There will also be a training session with Esther for interviewers. Thanks to all who signed up.

AI Ethics Conversations - not many people have signed up with an idea yet; and 2 of the suggested ideas are actually being covered at the AGI-24 pre-event instead. So requesting more ideas from members.

Confirmed that the "Creating learning resources" budget line has been pushed to Q4, if at all - and noted that Education Guild is already doing some similar work this quarter; there may be scope for collaboration. Vani asked if WGs who are working on learning resources could add a note to the relevant issue on our board, so when we plan for Q4 we know what's been done and don't tread on toes.

On plans for Q3 interviewing: we discussed wide range of good ideas from members; but we're over budget so members are asked to cut down their totals to a max of $200. Confirmed that we want to interview a range of people, from AI professionals to people with no prior knowledge of AI; and importance of covering a range of demographics. Discussed idea of interviewing teenagers - there are additional ethics issues involved, but it should be possible. Also confirmed that we can do more interviewing in Q4.




#### Decision Items:
- Agreed to use part of our next meeting (19th Aug) to discuss principles around money, work and payments
  - [rationale] there have been some disagreements around payments for strategy-writing tasks; it is a subject we need to address and possibly should have addressed earlier
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- Issue #26 (Producing learning resources)  to be moved to Q4
  - [rationale] Budget-fitting. Also noted that Education WG is creating (video) learning resources on AI Ethics this quarter, so if we do work on this in Q4 we should keep aware of what they have done so we don't overlap.
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- Signups for roles at AGI-24 and the pre-event on 7th August have now closed. 
  - [rationale] All the roles are filled
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- Costs for the Q3 interviewing "mini-projects" to be capped at $200 each. People who have proposed a set of interviews should edit their budgets to fit
  - [rationale] we are c. $1,000 over budget for the work overall
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup

ONBOARD NEW MEMBERS/CORE MEMBER ROLL CALL - 2 new people (i.e. Yedi and MartinSoki) have indicated an interest in becoming core members of the Strategy Guild since the last meeting; however, they haven’t met the requirements.

Ayo explained how everyone can become a member, and also contribute and be a part of what is happening within the guild.


STRATEGY GUILD CORE TAG (VERIFICATION AND ASSIGNING) - There is a need for verification of those who have met the requirements and are eligible for the Strategy Guild core member tag. 
Currently, 5 people have met the requirement (i.e. Ayo, Gorga, Effiom, Tuso, and Lord Kizzy). Their other Guild and WG tags need to be verified.

Ayo highlighted that this is meant to be an async process and should be managed by someone. Effiom was nominated to take up this role and he accepted.
Other points raised during this discussion:
* Should there be tags for intending members of the guild who are yet to meet all the requirements to become Core members?

* Which of the requirements should be relaxed for this category?


STRATEGY GUILD Q3 RESEARCH - The document is closed, no more contributions. The next phase is discussions on the execution.

  - [Workgroup Syncing call: Rolling Agenda ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Mdxr2DT9LOi_-7ZS7oIC69ilY67oGqReVhvOuNwUgYQ/edit)

#### Agenda Items:
- Facilitation and Documentation of WG Syncing call
- Budget Deficiencies due to devaluation of AGIX
- Facilitating and documenting next 3 Town Halls after the 13th of August

#### Discussion:
-Facilitation and Documentation of WG Syncing call: 
Peter suggested a rotation model for facilitation and documentation. He asked members if they were interested in facilitating this call; Onize offered to facilitate the next one, but nobody present felt ready to do this one, so Peter continued facilitating it.


-Budget deficiencies due to devaluation of AGIX: 
Slate highlighted that the budget-fitting cuts (24.8%) and the recent token price devaluation sums up to almost a 50% cut to workgroups' original Q3 budgets, which is not feasible for workgroups to operate. There was a suggestion for some workgroups to shift to bi-weekly sessions rather than weekly, but some members felt that the allocation for meeting facilitation and documentation is a small portion of their budget allocation and reducing meeting sessions doesn’t make significant changes. Peter indicated that there is provision for up to 10% to cover token price depreciation; but for anything more than that, while there is a program-wide reserve obtained from leftover budgets from workgroups, in the current system there is no sustainable way of maintaining the reserves if we are taking from it. Lordkizzy highlighted that workgroups' Quarterly report on deliverables will be hugely affected by the budget deficiencies, as they will be unlikely to be able to deliver all that they planned to do. Vanessa suggested that for Q4, WGs may need to decide whether to prioritise keeping the WG running, or doing project-based work (and that decision will vary from WG to WG). She also suggested WGs could each select 1 item that they really want to do but can no longer afford, and ask for it to be funded from reserves.


-Facilitating and documenting next 3 Town Halls after the 13th: 
Peter indicated that he won’t be available for the 3 Town Halls (20th, 27th, 3rd of next month). 3 members volunteered (Onize, Guillermo,, Clement). Peter highlighted that he would create a full open process by posting it on the Ambassadors General Discord channel for everyone to volunteer and then we will decide from there.



#### Decision Items:
- We decided that Lordkizzy would document the session and Onize will facilitate the next session. 
  - [rationale] Peter facilitated this call since there wasn't anyone interest in doing so 
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup

#### Action Items:
- [action] Onize to facilitate the next WG Syncing Call on 9th September.  [assignee] Onize [due] 5 September 2024 [status] todo
- [action] All WGs/Guilds to try to prioritize activities and make cuts within their budget. [assignee] All WGs/Guilds [due] 5 September 2024 [status] todo

#### To carry over for next meeting:
- Budget Deficiencies: Due to Devaluation of AGIX

### Writers Workgroup

- Type of meeting: Weekly
- Present: Cjfrankie  [facilitator], Gorga Siagian, CallyFromAuron [documenter], Kenichi, Mikasa, cjfrankie, LadyTempestt, devon, Gorga Siagian, Advanceameyaw, Merryman, Eveline Trinite, Nengi, Inésgav, WaKa, Emmanuel Isaac, Eric Davies, Nebula1224
- Purpose: Weekly meeting of the writers workgroup 
- Working Docs:
  - [WWG Scribbler Onboarding Form](https://forms.gle/yLzrMbtUjjhcgWUj9)
  - [SNET WWG-TEST](https://docs.google.com/document/d/119vvftlF8IVEo-82kq3Fyq559WZwlgAeAej8SX43_uE/edit)

#### Narrative:
Agenda items:
1) Updates on ongoing projects
2) WWG Test results
3) Zealy board
4) Q3 Report and Q4 Budget
5) Governance Call
6) Points system

1) Updates on ongoing projects:
Slate has replied to Kenichi's message and said he will complete his work regarding the “Harnessing AI & Blockchain" AMA.

2) WWG test results
Kenichi said that there are four tests that have been reviewed. He also noticed that a new test had been submitted and asked other Scribes to review it. Kenichi recommends that the three participants who have taken the test should retake it. He will send this information to the reviewers (scribes) so they can contact the participants.

2) Zealy board
Kenichi added video workgroup quests to the Zealy board, and discussed the backlog of older quests.

Kenichi has created a channel for Zealy reviewers and the channel is up and running

Several assignments are awaiting review from Devon, who responded that he will review them today. Apart from that, Kenichi explained that now Zealy tasks carry out this process on a weekly basis, meaning that every weekend there are new tasks that will be done or released for review. Devon will send more quests on the Zealy board today.

Regarding the old quest backlog, Kenichi let some tasks from the previous sprint remain intending to maintain a balance between old participants and new. The main goal is to engage newcomers, so he wants to ensure that frequent participants don't always have an edge over new participants.

4) Q3 Report and Q4 Budget
On the Q3 report: Kenichi reported that there are now more than 220 Medium subscribers; the aim is more than 300 before the end of the quarter. If we achieve this target, it will exceed WWG members' own expectations for this quarter. WWG members have two months left to reach that goal.
Kenichi admitted that content publication was a little slow, which is understandable because WWG's budget was only approved at the end of July. However, it is currently trying to catch up, and in August, there will be a lot of content published.
Regarding Twitter/X followers, Kenichi reports that the SNET Ambassador Twitter has more than 1,200 followers, and continues to grow.
On onboarding, WWG has successfully onboarded two new writers and plans to add several more before the end of the quarter. Kenichi also mentioned that the group needs to discuss whether to open the onboarding process for the fourth quarter (Q4) or not.

5) Governance calls
Attendance at Governance calls, and the importance of representation in Town Halls, were emphasized, alongside updates on the Cogito collaboration project.

6) Points system
We agreed to do a delegation process, where scribblers will signpost other scribblers to attend the point system distribution calls with Kenichi and a scribe, to get a glimpse of how the rewards are distributed every month.
