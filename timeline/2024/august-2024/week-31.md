#### Narrative:
Our first meeting in August started strong with a warm welcome greeting from Kenichi, and momentarily, he surfed the WG’s Dework board to cite the tasks in progress — Gorga, Inés, and Devon gave us an update on their tasks. Following that, Kenichi emphasized that scribblers should always keep prior bars in mind. Then Cjfrankie shared insights into his journey by providing Gorga with assistance as a new scribbler!


Meeting Agenda: Having ticked off the action items from the last meeting, the meeting officially started with a discussion on July’s points system. Kenichi said that the disbursement didn't happen last Tuesday because there were still many tasks left undone and we needed to clear that off. 


Agenda item number three featured a discussion about September projections! Kenichi said that we might be a mile away from launching the long-anticipated podcast. He also hinted that the marketing guild and video workgroup will play a role in making the podcast come to life. Lastly, he mentioned that anyone interested can start a conversation or a thread in the writers' Discord channel.


Following that, we talked about the Q2 SNET ambassador program's monthly recap and the future recaps for Substack. Since the recaps are usually lengthy, Kenichi said that there's a need to split the recap into workgroups and guild updates separately. 


Onboarding: From a bird's-eye view, there is a massive surge of interest in the WWG. Kenichi pointed out that we have almost reached our KPI for Q3, and at the moment there are only three spots left for scribblers this quarter, so the onboarding window for Q3 2024 will be closed after we have onboarded five scribblers in Q3.

From the Zealy side of things, Cjfrankie talked about spotting a user who has multiple accounts. Gorga, LordKizzy, and several other people present gave their opinions on how we can mitigate the issue. Kenichi added that we can't prevent users from having multiple accounts, and the best approach would be to do a check after the sprint. Whenever we cite multiple accounts by a user, we can check the proof of humanity by tracking how old their Twitter account is or by using the sprinter tag to track how old the account is, and finally, any rewards will only go to one account. 


Following that, Devon shared updates from the video reviews on Zealy. As a matter of finality, LordKizzy suggested that we have a channel where we can discuss Zealy-related topics.



#### Decision Items:
- Following a discussion with Zealy about how to address the issue of users having multiple accounts, we have decided that whenever we cite a user that has multiple accounts, we select one out and send the rewards.

#### Discussion Points:
- Updates on task management: Malik indicated that he had created the monthly recurrent tasks on Dework and there were 3 new applications which were all rejected after the review process. There was a short clip submitted by Rojo and Lily and it's an animated clip and they requested for $50 per person. The whole  group took a look at the video and commended the work but the major concern was the compensation for the work. Lordkizzy made emphasis on the tight budget the video WG are currently working with for Q3 and said it will be outrageous to pay $50 per person ($100) for a clip when we have a budget of $20 each for 12 clips. Lily dropped in and mentioned that the entire video was created from scratch and we should consider it as a long video rather than a clip. Slate said that once we pay this out, someone can perform a similar task and be expecting the same pay which is not feasible for us, so Lordkizzy suggested we compensate Rojo and Lily's efforts with $30 each. We decided to put it to a poll since the conversation was taking a while. Malik also indicated that he had a discussion with Lordkizzy on the quality of our Town Hall videos.
- Updates from Social Media Management: Tuso highlighted that he was able to ensure that the townhall videos were posted earlier and he would upload two more clips before the week runs out.
- Zealy updates: Devon highlighted that there has been one quest and it's doing well but we should be expecting more quests by Sunday.
- Updates from Lordkizzy: Lordkizzy highlighted that he had a call with Devon on the Zealy program to see the progress so far and discuss the challenges regarding our contents; he also mentioned that he had a call during the week with Rojo to discuss the types of videos that should be created by the Video Workgroup like: Ecosystem updates videos, Announcement videos, and not just educational videos.
- Social Media Automation: Rojo indicated that he was previously working on Buffer but he has come across a more suitable open source platform for social media automation which is called MIXpost. There was a question from Zalfred to Rojo on "if the platform would lead to a reduction of video quality of the content", and  Rojo said there would be more testing of the tool to ensure this doesn't occur. Lordkizzy asked how we could know the most suitable time for posting contents; Rojo answered that the platform is currently working to develop this feature but should be expecting that feature soon.
- Introduction of new members: Bazoo and King David introduced themselves.
- Animation discussion: We discussed on some animation platforms and their payment plans and how feasible they would be for the entire workgroup. So far, we have Whiteboard Animation Maker, Videoscribe, Animated and Canva. Malik also suggested Synthesia, a platform that makes characters talk.
- Quality control process: Lordkizzy had some questions for the group on the anonymity of the reviewers, the selected timeline, and so on, we had so many suggestions but we couldn't make any decisions due to the low numbers in participation from members.
