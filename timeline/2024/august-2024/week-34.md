  - [Ambassador Program Budget Planner](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BBogj9rAO52cpdGP3uvp8hAHNa4Qw66lz9JLjSC2yVs/edit?usp=sharing)

#### Narrative:
The meeting discussed the process and timeline for Q4 budget submission and approval.

We resolved comments in the Q4 context-setting doc, and made a minor change to the timeline. We noted 
1) that we need to ensure Tevo is aware of the proposed dates;
2) that we need to establish when the list of Core Contributors will be re-calculated, and what the dates for the "opt-in" process for being a Core Contributor will be.

We discussed the context-setting doc's section on valid reasons for objecting, and the idea of asking people not to "nit-pick" small details, but to focus on things that would actually do harm to the Program if they were agreed.

We discussed whether we should say that people who raise objections need to be present at the relevant discussion meetings or not

We discussed how we will keep core contributors engaged and informed through the whole consent process, by sharing short memos that cover which concerns have been addressed so far and which are still outstanding.

We discussed the wording for Guillermo's two infographics: 1) reminding WGs to submit their budgets by 9th Sept and 2) encouraging Core Contributors to take part in the consent process; and agreed that Guillermo and Vani will make final tweaks to the wording as soon as possible

We noted that when the consent process opens, Peter has already said he will contact Core Contributors via DM to encourage them to take part.

We discussed at leangth what should happen if a WG does not submit their budget in time. We recognised that late submission should be strongly discouraged because it holds the whole process up. In previous Quarters, it has been suggested that a WG that does not submit a budget should have to work on their previous quarter's budget - but this time, this would not be workable since the token price is so much lower than it was for Q3, so most WGs' Q3 budgets would be more than we could afford. There has been a suggestion in the past that a WG who submits late should get no budget - but this is not a good idea, especially not for WGs that are "core" to the Program. So we agreed on late submitters getting a minimal budget, the exact amount to be determined by referencing their previous Quarters' budgets and the token price at the time. 

We agreed this idea needs to go out to all WG leads - who are all core contributors, so it could be done via the Core Contributor tag - to check they agree with it.



#### Decision Items:
- We agreed a minor amendment to the timeline for Q4 budget approval - see Q4 Context Setting doc
  - [rationale] mainly to avoid consent forms needing to be sent out on a Saturday.
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We agreed that for each iteration of the consent process, we will re-post Guillermo's infographic encouraging core contributors to take part. 
  - [rationale] Because in previous quarters, some people only engaged in the first round of consent
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We agreed that for each iteration of the consent process, when we post Guillermo's infographic, we will also post something to highlight the core concerns that have been raised, plus any response from the relevant WGs
  - [rationale] because it might encourage core contributors to get involved; they might be finding it difficult to sort through the information and view the concerns in the budget calculator spreadsheet
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We agreed that we need to document and publicise the process better. First, after each discussion meeting we should put out a memo covering what has been agreed, and which concerns have been addressed/resolved. Second, our archive documentation of discussion meetings needs to specify the concerns raised and the responses that WGs gave. 
  - [rationale] Partly to make it easier for people to see what has been decided without having to read a whole meeting summary, and avoid resolved concerns being raised again in the next consent round. And partly to help with longer-term tracking issues from quarter to quarter. (It has previously been raised, in consent process retrospectives, that we should ensure that concerns raised about a WG in one Quarter are actually addressed in practice in the next Quarter.) 
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We agreed that the "memo" mentioned above should be either a doc, or a link to the meeting summary in the Archives, and it should be linked in the next iteration of the consent form, so people can see at a glance which concerns have already been addressed. We noted that the Governance WG has budget that could pay a documenter to do this additional task.
  - [rationale] To make it easier for people to keep track of the whole process, and to avoid concerns being resubmitted when they have already been addressed.
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We agreed that this meeting thinks that if a WG does not submit their budget in time, they will be removed from the consent process and allocated a minimal budget for Q4, which will be worked out by using the operational element of their previous budgets as a reference (i.e. the budget element for actually running the WG - meetings, facilitation, documentation etc).
  - [rationale] To avoid issues that have arisen in the past when WGs don't submit in time, where others have had to decide what to submit on their behalf
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- Further to the above, we agreed that this idea should be shared in the Ambassador General Discord channel and the Decision-to-be-Made Discord channel to all WG leads using the "Core Contributor" tag (all WG leads are Core Contributors, as far as we know) 
  - [rationale] To check that there are no objections to this approach of those who submit their budget late being removed from the consent process and being allocated a minimal budget
  - [opposing] There were several caveats but no actual objections
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We decided that it would be best for the context-setting doc to say that it is useful (but not mandatory) for objectors to be present at discussion meetings
  - [rationale] Mainly because people are not always clear in what they write, so it can help if they are present when it is discussed
  - [opposing] There was a suggestion that an ideal consent process should be designed so objections can be discussed even if the objector is not present - but we recognised that in practice, in past iterations, it has helped to have the objector present.
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We agreed that when the time comes to start reminding Core Contributors to take part in the Q4 consent process, it would be useful if all WGs could mention it at the start of their meetings
  - [rationale] to ensure that the info is shared widely, and reaches people where they are.
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
