### Writers Workgroup

- **Type of meeting:** Weekly
- **Present:** Cjfrankie  [**facilitator**], Ines [**documenter**], Kenichi, cjfrankie, LadyTempestt, devon, Gorga Siagian, Advanceameyaw, Nebula, King David, Emmanuel Issac, Evelyn Robert, Merryman, Kareem, Ines
- **Purpose:** Weekly meeting of the writers workgroup.
- **Working Docs:**
  - [DRAFT: WWG Q3 Report ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cqzXDc73Fx1eZdQlEA8lj9YBag-h6Zj9Si9bI18hQLY/edit?usp=sharing)

#### Narrative:
The meeting kicked off with Guillermo Lucero opening the call; he welcomed everyone and then left the meeting. A couple of minutes later, Kenichi arrived and joined the conversation, which was facilitated by CJ Frankie. We started by checking the action items from the last meeting.

After CJ Frankie, Lady Tempestt, and InÃ©s GaviÃ±a commented on the importance of creating a team-based Q3 budget and improving our proposal submission for next quarter, Kenichi shared the Q3 budget draft in the Writers WG Discord channel; see link here WWG Q3 Report: DRAFT: WWG Q3 Report. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cqzXDc73Fx1eZdQlEA8lj9YBag-h6Zj9Si9bI18hQLY/edit?usp=sharing

Kenichi highlighted that the whole Ambassador Program is dealing with budget constraints due to token depreciation, and stated that we wouldnâ€™t be able to add much to the budget. He also shared that the proposal was still incomplete and in a draft state and that every WG member could comment and share their insights and ideas for it.   

Lady Tempestt insisted on the importance of sharing the budget-writing process as Kenichi cannot have eyes on everything, and how he could share numbers and metrics so that different WG members could help him write reports. On the other hand, Kenichi expressed the impossibility of sharing certain ambassadors' accounts with everybody and that writing the budget proposal requires technical information that can only be found on the Ambassador Zealy and Substack. 

Lady Tempestt shared her interest in hosting the SEO workshop and stated that we wouldnâ€™t need too much budget to do it, with 100 or 200 USD would be enough. Kenichi believed that as we are a writers' group we should be focusing on writing and discussing topics and subjects. Kenichi suggested that maybe the Marketing Guild was interested in hosting such a workshop, although he warned about how the Marketing Guild is still starting to organize itself and is not able to amplify our articles yet. 

Lady Tempestt also shared her concern on how we are not publishing How-to articles. Kenichi answered that the WG was always flexible and open to new ideas as with InÃ©sâ€™s We Are Reading series. Kenichi suggested Lady Tempestt bring her ideas into the Discord and share them with the WG.
 
Kenichi also shared his concern regarding the new Zealy sprint, and his reflections and ideas on how to avoid the continuous bot intervention. He said that the backbone of the Zealy Quest is to onboard new members to the Ambassador Program and with the multiplication of fake accounts and members joining again and again the dynamic is not working. He shared the idea of reducing the points in each quest and reducing the points on the onboarding task to avoid bots and fake accounts. InÃ©s GaviÃ±a asked Kenichi if the LATAM Guild could share quests with the Global Zealy Sprint and Kenichi said that would be a fantastic idea. 

Kenichi commented he found some inconsistencies within the reviews of the Writers WG tests, he felt that sometimes reviewers are afraid to put low numbers in the test and he suggested we shouldn't be afraid to put low numbers on tests that are not up to the level of the Ambassador Program. 


Updates:
Although still facing low engagement, the Spanish and French X accounts are finally activating themselves and starting to create content. 

Feedback on Eric Davies's not-approved test; writers shared with him the importance of proper research and thorough reading of the test objectives.

### Gamers Guild

- Type of meeting: Biweekly
- Present: Slate [facilitator], devon [documenter], Gorga Siagian, Photogee, hotasiro, martinsoki, kateri, malik, Merryman, CollyPride, SubZero
- Purpose: The meeting focused on budget allocation for various tasks.

  - [Budget Request for Q4(Gamers Guild)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZNbHXepnCglgrX_4HhGemwdD521KTPocuQaPJUTZRLI/edit?gid=0#gid=0)
  - [Sophiaverse Collaboration Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n21IBNuY7l5sSq65Au0NM1Zaoco1x6ScCPMKk-Gbcl0/edit?usp=sharing)

#### Discussion Points:
- Slate discussed the meeting agenda.

- The budget, including some new tasks (Retrospective Guidance and Support for WG Creators; Collaboration with Sophiaverse Testing; Deep dive into platforms such as Decentraland & Sandbox; Main Game Aspect Development; Map Creation of VR) was then discussed. 
- Retrospective Guidance and Support for WG Creators - Unlike mentoring, which offers one-time guidance, this task focuses on rewarding those who assist workgroup creators in developing specific elements, such as creating a designated room in the building for them.
- Collaboration with Sophiaverse Testing - This task focuses on integrating the Sophiaverse dialogue system into the Roblox platform, testing the dialogue system, and having each member create a report on their findings.
- Deep dive into platforms like Decentraland and Sandbox to assess their suitability for VR creation. Participants will test these platforms and compile a report, as Slate noted their similarities to Roblox.
- Main Game Aspect Development - This task focuses on rewarding the enhancements made to the main VR Game other than WG creations like the cafeteria, gym, and similar features.
- Map Creation of VR - Slate introduced a small city VR map which will include the Ambassador program university. The players will spawn in the city and will be guided to the university. To develop this city, two WG creators will be selected based on their performance to aid Slate in modeling this city.

- Slate discussed asset creation, noting that members can create up to 8 assets each month. He also highlighted the two assets created by Gorga that were approved by the members.

- Slate showcased the quarterly report by Lord Kizzy

- Slate explained the dialogue system Doc that Berick shared. The system uses a JSON file structure to manage dialogue layers, reply information, and choices. Slate mentioned that while Roblox lacks certain features like emotion systems available in other game engines (e.g. Unity), the system still supports essential dialogue elements like choices and flowchart design. Slate noted that some advanced features, like history tracking and valence settings, are not supported in Roblox but are available in other engines.
- Slate mentioned the potential benefits, including recognition, financial rewards, and increased budgets for contributors who will test the dialogue system effectively.

- Slate also demonstrated the health system within Roblox, detailing how health can deplete and be restored through various means.
- He also showed the working tutorials for each separate deliverable on YouTube.
