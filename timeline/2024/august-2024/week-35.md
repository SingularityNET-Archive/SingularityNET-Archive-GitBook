- UPDATE STATUS ON DEVELOPMENT: AJ and Advanceameyaw gave updates on the Collaboration Skill Database; they presented the work done so far visually, and requested for feedback on whether it would be suitable to add existing data to the database, should individuals be allowed to share re edit their data, also who are the individuals that would be granted the admin access for the projects and so on.  Lordkizzy gave some clarity on the scope of the project and suggested that the existing data  should be differentiated from the new data, admin access should be granted to the Onboarders, WG leads and the Development team. AJ and Advanceameyaw also requested two more weeks from the initial deadline for development and testing.
- UPDATE STATUS ON DEVELOPMENT: Kenichi gave updates on the Legacy System. He spoke about the necessity of having an NDA for the project; he also mentioned that work is ongoing on the landing page so that WGs can incorporate all the work they have been doing, and a presentation will be done in the next call showing the skeletal system showing the wire frame with some UI on the Legacy System.
