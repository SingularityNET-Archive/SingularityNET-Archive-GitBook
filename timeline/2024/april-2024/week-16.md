  - [rationale] After discussion and decisionmaking on ideas for budget items from WG members, removing some items that we did in Q1 and no longer need, and adjusting prices for some of the "bounty-style" tasks that are continued from Q1 to reflect the amount of work they involve, we agreed a final budget request for Q2 of $7,670
- We note that the Supervisory Council will be discussing, and hopefully deciding on, our input on supporting their knowledge management processes with the Blueprint doc on 19th April 2024, which has been in discussion since January 2024.
  - [rationale] They now have clarity on what budget they have (tho it will obviously be dependent on token price); and the SC's term of office ends in May so a decision is needed
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- On timestamping BGI videos: we noted Duke has needed to drop out due to pressure of other work. Also - it's now 8 videos, not 9. Timestamps will be added as comments, rather than in the description
  - [rationale] Only 8 videos because the 9th has already been timestamped. Timestamps as a comment, rather than in the description: no need to organise access to DF Youtube; also, makes it transparent who did them.
