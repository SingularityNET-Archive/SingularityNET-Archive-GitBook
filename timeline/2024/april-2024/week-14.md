  - [Meeting Issue](https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/128)

#### Decision Items:
- Quarterly report for Q1 2024 - there have been a couple of minor changes suggested. Also we want to try out presenting it in a format that is more closely linked to our budget request  - e.g. via notes on the budget spreadsheetfor Q1
  - [rationale] spreadsheet approach might connect reporting more closely to budget request, to support tracking and accountability, which is something that has been discussed in general terms in Treasury Guild meetings
  - [opposing] The existing text-based format is probably more readable, and allows a WG to make narrative points about how their work has gone. Worth trying both formats.
