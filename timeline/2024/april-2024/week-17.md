#### Decision Items:
- Minutes of last meeting (11th April) agreed
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- We agreed that last week's Treasury info session was great and very useful; and that the edit of the video of gthe session should include the material on the token merger
  - [rationale] Because although it makes the video less "timeless", it is important information
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We  decided that our Onboarding session on 16th May will include a walk-through of the Discord server, which will be recorded in advance
  - [rationale] To ensure it doesn't acidentally breach anyone's privacy by showing something, on a video that will be shared on Youtube, that anyone might prefer not to be shared that way
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- Next steps for Onboarding Journeys - the scripts will be changed so they are a 3rd-person narrator; info will be added on barriers that may be faced by the female character because she is female
  - [rationale] 3rd person is better because if we use 1st person, it could give the misleading impression that these are real people rather than composites; and it would mean we need to recruit appropriate voices to voice them
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- We briefly discussed Gorga's proposal on creating educational materials, and agreed that perhaps it would be best as a collaboration between Oboarding, Translation, and Education guilds, probably in Q3
  - [rationale] Because it addresses mainly education and translation issues, and Onboarding can't fund it this Quarter
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- Gorga asked if he could be paid to be a mentor to new member Franklyn, but the group decided against it, but noted that Gorga, llike all of us, can still help Franklyn even without officially being his mentor
  - [rationale] because Gorga himself is quite new to the program, and doesn't yet have enough knowledge to mentor someone effectively. 
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- There was a bit of tension in the meeting with people misunderstanding each other, especially about who was offering to do which tasks
  - [rationale] There is a certain amount of competition to be assigned paid tasks
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup

The meeting began with Kenichi‚Äôs warm comment on the first ‚ÄúWe Are Reading‚Äù article from In√©s. 
Questions regarding the relief of workload arose. This is where the Scribe role comes in handy: Scribes can assist with the writing of budget proposals, and more!
We want to spice up the Friday trivia sessions to make it more interesting and fun; Kenichi will incorporate other genres like music, sports, movies, and more.
Kenichi shared information about the implementation of a poll to enable Trivia players to choose the next genre or area of focus - for example, if "movies" gets more votes in the poll - expect to see movie questions in the trivia - Awesome right?
Our first podcast is set to commence next quarter. In this regard, we need:
- Audio-visual specialist 
- Designers 
- Writers (available)
- Analysis and promotion person 
- Documenter
- Social media manager (available)
Kenichi introduced the idea of ‚ÄúSoulbound Tokens.‚Äù They will serve as proof of participation; individuals can use them to see the Writers' Discord channel etc.
Kareem shared an update on the brand assets.
Kenichi introduced the latest WWG‚Äôs ‚ÄúScribe‚Äù in the person of Cjfrankie.
