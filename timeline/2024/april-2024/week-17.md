  - [document on Naming context](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cFhmCL9ip8I8UoglDU1_hhpL5PMHpTVoAnNgTZjhG_k/edit?usp=sharing)
  - [Q2 budget sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BBogj9rAO52cpdGP3uvp8hAHNa4Qw66lz9JLjSC2yVs/edit#gid=2094170945)

  - [Moderators Workgroup](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MuKE2SOKiQs08te-lZcb5hn66163oOLSx0MSGO4WZz4/edit?usp=sharing)

#### Discussion Points:
- Next steps on Contributors' decision-making tools. Blocker: suggested tools (e.g. CitizenOS) may not fit greatly, particularly as they support voting rather than consent decision making. Suggestion to look at https://colony.io/
-  Next steps on Q2 2024 Budget decision process
- Continued discussion of the idea of a Governance Sandbox to test governance tooling.
- Kickstart new Moderators' Workgroup. Blocker: uncertainty on how to currently start a new WG
- Q2 2024 budget for this Workgroup (see https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DeUB6ytoOeG6SOHwhJxe-vII_mXmkjdxG1iD-f5B2Sc/edit?usp=sharing) 

#### Decision Items:
- We should separate Gov Sandbox from the current decision-making processes at the Core Contributors.


  - [**rationale**] Tool testing should be done by Guilds/WGs themselves before being suggested to the full Core Contributors decision-making process
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- Suggestion to look at https://colony.io/ as a decision-making tool
  - [**rationale**] It appears to allow a consent process, rather than voting, so it would fit the approach we are currently experimenting with.
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- Q2 2024 Budget approval process to be done in the same way as we did for Q1 
  - [**rationale**] Tho we want to make small improvements based on retrospective about Q1
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- GovWG will take initiative to push for introducing & supporting setup of the new Moderators WG, and will include Moderators budget in Governance WG's Q2 Budget allocation.
  - [**rationale**] because we agree such a WG is needed, and it is unclear at present how it should be set up
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We will use this doc https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MuKE2SOKiQs08te-lZcb5hn66163oOLSx0MSGO4WZz4/edit?usp=sharing to ideate on the Moderators WG
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- Q2 budget for Governance WG - we will ideate on this async in this spreadsheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DeUB6ytoOeG6SOHwhJxe-vII_mXmkjdxG1iD-f5B2Sc/edit?usp=sharing.
  - [**rationale**] because we didn't get time to discuss it properly in the meeting. Felix has started, by budgeting only for the sessions (~40$ per session), but he has not yet included any follow-up tasks or async work; so we need to think about what should be included.
  - [**effect**] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- On the question of how to set up a new WG in general, we will try to follow the ideas in this draft doc from Onboarding WG https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qT7C3Kb99tM5PzGej3GxCK-hhxlY5LEXnShNspixj24/edit and see how well it works.
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople

#### Decision Items:
- Minutes of last meeting (11th April) agreed
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- We agreed that last week's Treasury info session was great and very useful; and that the edit of the video of gthe session should include the material on the token merger
  - [rationale] Because although it makes the video less "timeless", it is important information
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We  decided that our Onboarding session on 16th May will include a walk-through of the Discord server, which will be recorded in advance
  - [rationale] To ensure it doesn't acidentally breach anyone's privacy by showing something, on a video that will be shared on Youtube, that anyone might prefer not to be shared that way
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- Next steps for Onboarding Journeys - the scripts will be changed so they are a 3rd-person narrator; info will be added on barriers that may be faced by the female character because she is female
  - [rationale] 3rd person is better because if we use 1st person, it could give the misleading impression that these are real people rather than composites; and it would mean we need to recruit appropriate voices to voice them
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- We briefly discussed Gorga's proposal on creating educational materials, and agreed that perhaps it would be best as a collaboration between Oboarding, Translation, and Education guilds, probably in Q3
  - [rationale] Because it addresses mainly education and translation issues, and Onboarding can't fund it this Quarter
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- Gorga asked if he could be paid to be a mentor to new member Franklyn, but the group decided against it, but noted that Gorga, llike all of us, can still help Franklyn even without officially being his mentor
  - [rationale] because Gorga himself is quite new to the program, and doesn't yet have enough knowledge to mentor someone effectively. 
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- There was a bit of tension in the meeting with people misunderstanding each other, especially about who was offering to do which tasks
  - [rationale] There is a certain amount of competition to be assigned paid tasks
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup

#### Action Items:
- [action] At onboarding session on 16th May: LadyTempestt will facilitate, Gorga will document, LordKizzy will run the Q&A, and Clement will prepare a video walk-through of Discord. [assignee] LadyTempestt, Gorga Siagian, lord kizzy, Clement Umoh [due] 16 May 2024 [status] todo

- [action] Sucre to reach out to Education WG about Gorga's education proposal [assignee] SucrenSpice [due] 2 May 2024 [status] todo

- We need to adhere to orderliness in our weekly meetings, not speaking over each other.

#### To carry over for next meeting:

- Purpose: The meeting features discussions centered on podcasts.
#### Narrative:
The meeting began with Kenichi’s warm comment on the first “We Are Reading” article from Inés. 
Questions regarding the relief of workload arose. This is where the Scribe role comes in handy: Scribes can assist with the writing of budget proposals, and more!
We want to spice up the Friday trivia sessions to make it more interesting and fun; Kenichi will incorporate other genres like music, sports, movies, and more.
Kenichi shared information about the implementation of a poll to enable Trivia players to choose the next genre or area of focus - for example, if "movies" gets more votes in the poll - expect to see movie questions in the trivia - Awesome right?
Our first podcast is set to commence next quarter. In this regard, we need:
- Audio-visual specialist 
- Designers 
- Writers (available)
- Analysis and promotion person 
- Documenter
- Social media manager (available)
Kenichi introduced the idea of “Soulbound Tokens.” They will serve as proof of participation; individuals can use them to see the Writers' Discord channel etc.
Kareem shared an update on the brand assets.
Kenichi introduced the latest WWG’s “Scribe” in the person of Cjfrankie.


#### Decision Items:
- We plan to use Notion for better management of the podcast activities.
