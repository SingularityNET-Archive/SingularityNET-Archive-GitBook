# Week 45

## Monday 4th November 2024


### Strategy Guild

- **Type of meeting:** Biweekly
- **Present:** Photogee [**facilitator**], Cjfrankie  [**documenter**], Ayo, Photogee, Eric Davies, LordKizzy, Effiom, kateri, martinsoki, Mikasa, AshleyDawn, Clement Umoh
- **Purpose:** Biweekly meeting of the Strategy Guild

- **Working Docs:**
  - [Strategy Guild Working Document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hfAXNfkdS9avyAZSH0oG9CJj7bQQEd1qfvedyaNeH5U/edit?gid=1268899826#gid=1268899826)
  - [The Strategy Guild Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1FVYpm_Q1r97pK8h1PdKX-ntyvDozv2d1GXYr-BNy8hA/edit)

#### Narrative:
Kick-off: Photogee welcomed everyone with a warm greeting, and then we tackled the action items from the last meeting. Effiom shared an update on the status of the "strategy core" and "strategy member" Discord tags. He stated that the tags haven’t taken effect because there’s still a back-and-forth issue that needs to be fixed. He hinted that at the next meeting or workshop, he’d give an update on the status.

Budget Fitting: Momentarily, we had a budget fitting walkthrough by Effiom; some deliverables will be moved to Q1 2025 and there will only be 1 workshop session in Q4, while a few things are removed to fit the budget. 

Q4 Task Roster & Async Follow-up: Ayo took to the stage and assured everyone with their names on the roster of getting a task in Q4. We also discussed what to do with members who haven’t been showing up for meetings; Ayo added that we can swap those names with active members who would like to take up tasks. We also discussed Q3 workshop follow-up. These groups of people will attend WG meetings of marketing guild, video workgroup, and writers workgroup, and collect information about what strategy was adopted in the workgroup from the last strategy guild workshop and how it’s going. To this effect, we have Photogee and Ese to take on the Q3 workshop follow-up while Cjfrankie and Mikasa take on the Q4 workshop follow-up.

More on Workshops: We have decided that there will be only one workshop session in Q4, focusing on R&D Guild and Education Guild. These workshops will start next Monday (11th Nov) and run for 3 straight weeks. Cjfrankie and Mikasa are to attend both the R&D and the Education guild meetings, and ask them to select three members that will represent them well.

Research Update: Effiom shared an update on the research he’s working on about what people in the Ambassador Program think about Strategy Guild. The survey form is complete and is ready to be sent out to gather responses from community members. He sought feedback on the survey and encouraged members to check out the form and add comments.

Looking Ahead: As Q4 wraps up, we looked forward to having a promising Q1 in 2025. Ayo said the strategy guild welcomes research ideas, initiatives, workshops, and collaboration from members. As a matter of finality, he added that Q1 2025 won’t only be about facilitation and documentation. Rather, it’s about strategy stuff.

AOB: The AOB session was led by Ayo, who sought two people who would liaise with the marketing guild for their content calendar — if we have any content for the socials, the idea is to have two people who would be in close communication with the marketing guild for proper scheduling of posts.


#### Decision Items:
- We have decided to hold only one workshop session in Q4. This workshop will focus on the R&D guild and education guild.

  - [today's meeting issue ](https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/216)

#### Decision Items:
- RAG workflow documentation: see issue https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/175 - we noted how quickly RAG technology is changing; and noted the importance of an open source ethos in how we approach it.
  - [**effect**] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- André's tool development this month has included adding a template for AI Sandbox/Think Tank. 
He has also been working on implementing a dropdown controlled vocab for the names of meeting participants. Some time ago, we agreed that we should use people's Discord names for this, ("Archive name = Discord name), and André has been looking at using a Discord bot to gather them. However, we notice that "Archive name = Discord name" has not been working that well - documenters don't apply it consistently, and particularly for new documenters, they might not know someone's Discord name if their Zoom name is different, so it causes confusion. So we have decided to use the name by which people have been most consistently recorded in the Archives, whether or not it matches their Discord name, to minimise the amount of changes that need to be made.

André proposed the same approach as we plan to use for tags: it will be possible to add a new name, but it will not appear immediately in the tool but will need to be approved. This means that if a documenter accidentally adds a name for someone who is already there in the controlled vocab, we can fix it.

  - [**rationale**] to resolve a barrier to good documentation, and ensure people are discoverable in the Archives.
  - [**opposing**] none
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We noted that in the Issue for our current (Q4 2024) budget https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/201, we said we would make some cuts to conform with budget fitting. 
This has been done, and as we've done in previous Quarters, we'll add something to the budget sheet on the right-hand side to show what changes were made.

We noted that the budget we submitted for Q4 was already severely cut, to try and address the low token price at the time - but we have still needed to make further cuts to conform to budget fitting. This has had an impact on the work we have been able to do. We noted that not all WGs did this in Q4 - some made little to no attempt to constrain the amount they asked for, and their high original budgets were perhaps intended to "give them something to cut". We note that the budget system we have at present basically incentivises workgroups to submit higher budgets than they need, in anticipation of budget fitting. 

This is obviously outside the scope of Archives WG to address, but we will raise it in Governance and/or Treasury; plus, we will mention it in our quarterly report.
  - [**rationale**] This issue has affected us strongly this Quarter, and is a shortcoming of the budget-fitting process, so we should mention our experience in Governance meetings.
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- When looking at the monthly Archives issues, we noted that documenting DeepFunding Town Hall can slow down the process (sometimes timestamps are not great, and additional work needs to be done to document the sessions in a meaningful way).

We wondered if DF itself could make any further contribution to the work - e.g. by paying someone from the Town Hall team to add the documentation to the summary tool?

We might also need to discuss how the Archives dovetails with documentation that DF is doing itself, such as https://community.deepfunding.ai/


  - [**rationale**] We noted that it is good and important that the Archives isn't insular, and includes material from beyond just the Ambassador Program.
  - [**opposing**] We noted that it might not be easy for DF to fund this directly via the Ambassador Program treasury system - but possibly they could pay it directly themselves?
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- In relation to the above, we recognised that we might need to include a budget line in Q1 2025 to support collaboration outside the Ambassador Program
  - [**rationale**] to enable us to capture material from other areas of the ecosystem, and have a more wide-ranging Archives that demonstrates the links and connections between the Ambassador Program and other areas of the ecosystem.
  - [**opposing**] None as such, although it might be difficult to do this comprehensively and still keep to a reasonable budget amount. It might be more about outreach to different parts of the ecosystem to see how we can support them with recordkeeping.
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- Also while discussing the monthly Archives issues, we noted that the backlog for Governance WG is largely because documenting Governance meetings isn't an entry-level task, and requires quite a lot of understanding of the Program as a whole in order to understand what's being discussed.
We agreed to mention in our Q4 quarterly report that some meetings are harder/more complex to document than others. This could also be raised in the WG Sync call at the end of November, as it might be something that will influence how much different WGs budget for documentation.
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We began discussing our budget for Q1 2025. As token price is still moderate to low, it will still need to be quite limited, and to focus on core development work. We plan to include work to build a dashboard to enable people to query the Archives corpus; and build on Ubio's work in Q3 on using AI to apply human generated tags; and we will perhaps aim to take a comparative research approach to looking at the value of AI tooling in a recordkeeping context - what *can* it do successfully, and what is better and more ethically approached using e.g. a database-type search? 

We also want to progress policy-writing - an AI ethics in recordkeeping policy, and an open-source policy.

  - [**rationale**] We note that this *is* an ethics issue if a RAG retrieval process cannot easily say if it doesn't know; cannot easily show its sources for verification; or cannot be fully constrained to a specific corpus.
  - [**effect**] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup

#### Action Items:
- [**action**] Video walkthru of how to use the GitHub Board - see https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/116  - not yet completed, but Onyeka will add the completed video to the Issue as soon as possible, and if needed, we'll review it in our November meeting.

#### Agenda item 1 - Operations SubGroup - [carry over]

#### Narrative:
Recent challenges, such as Solana’s Copa America, were discussed and the team’s efforts were acknowledged. Guillermo emphasised the value of diversity of capabilities within the group, while Daniela Alves proposed modifications to the organisation of tasks to optimise team performance. The importance of improving communication and organisation was underlined, as was the need for all members to actively contribute. Sergio highlighted the need to establish a clearer structure for teamwork, in order to facilitate the achievement of long-term objectives. Martin Rivero reflected on his experience in the team, pointing out the need for open communication and clear organisation in order to contribute effectively. A system for recording individual contributions was proposed and outstanding issues from the previous quarter were addressed, emphasising the importance of continued commitment by all.


#### Decision Items:

### Writers Workgroup

- **Type of meeting:** Weekly
- **Present:** CJFrankie [**facilitator**], CJFrankie [**documenter**], cjfrankie, LadyTempestt, Gorga Siagian, Mikasa, AshleyDawn, Evelyn Robert, Kateri Nick, devon, emmanuelisaac
- **Purpose:** Weekly meeting of the writers' workgroup 
- **Other media:** [Link](https://hackmd.io/z_rYIPn6RPSlKyLGcuaiSw)
#### Narrative:
Kick-off:  The weekly WWG meeting started at 3:10 PM with a welcome greeting from Cjfrankie. We began by reviewing the action items from the last meeting, including Kenichi's publication of the November 2nd ecosystem digest on Substack (see https://snetambassadorprogram.substack.com/p/singularitynet-ecosystem-digest-november). Cjfrankie encouraged everyone to read, subscribe, and engage with the newsletter if they haven't already. 

Dework Task Update: At the meeting, members including Lady Tempestt, Gorga, and Cjfrankie had ongoing tasks assigned on Dework. Lady Tempestt delegated her draft, 'Apespaces: What is Twin Protocol AI,' to Mikasa. Cjfrankie and Gorga have pending tasks and will make their submissions soon. Mikasa also added that she’d be expecting the next ecosystem digest draft from Cjfrankie by tomorrow.

Exploring Web3 Publishing Platforms:  Following a discussion on Medium page monetization, we decided to explore more Web3 publishing platforms. To this end, we have identified some potential tools, including Mirror, Lens, Paragraph, Arweave, and Warpcast. Cjfrankie highlighted the advantages of monetizing on Web3 platforms, such as decentralized revenue streams through NFT sales, direct ownership and control over content and revenue, community building via tokenization, and enhanced privacy and security. We need to learn more about these platforms, so Cjfrankie assigned some WG members to conduct research and present their findings in the next meeting. This research will cover each tool's functionality, how DAOs can use it, and pricing. Cjfrankie chose Mirror, Mikasa showed interest in Lens, Emmanuel Isaac selected Arweave, Love was assigned Paragraph, and Evelyn took Warpcast.

Q1 Budget and Q4 Report: Lady Tempestt sought clarification on the status of the Q1 2025 budget and Q4 2024 report. Mikasa cleared the air by saying that the Q1 budget is drafted already while the Q4 report is in progress. Lady Tempestt insisted that we share the drafts in the WWG channel so everyone can see it and leave comments. 

Content Calendar: As a matter of finality, the meeting featured Kateri, who kicked off a discussion about getting a list of email addresses from WWG members which will be given access to the content calendar so posts across the socials will be unified, time bound, and reach a wider audience. 

We called it a day and we ended the meeting at 3:30 PM.

- We've decided to explore more Web3 publishing platforms to unlock additional revenue streams and strengthen our connection with the community.
