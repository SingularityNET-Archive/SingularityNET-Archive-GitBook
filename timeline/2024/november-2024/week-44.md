#### Narrative:
Kick-off: The weekly meeting of the WWG started with Kenichi welcoming everyone to November. Unfortunately, we couldn’t use “read.AI” to record our meeting. Cjfrankie introduced a new tool that might work better than read.AI “speechlogger.com.” 

We skimmed through the minutes from the last meeting and we kicked off from where we left off. Kenichi started by asking the WWG members whether we want to make an end-of-year recap and how we are going to do it! Cjfrankie suggested that using meeting summaries might help; Kenichi brought the idea of exporting articles and statistics from the SingularityNET Ambassadors Medium page.

What’s next for Medium: It is worth mentioning that the SNET Ambassadors Medium page has been able to amass 318 followers and surpass 1,000 views per post. Kenichi hinted that it’s time we run a partnership program where writers can get paid for their publications. Also, he mentioned the fact that reaching 1,000 followers would mean that we could run ads and content outreaches. Momentarily, Cjfrankie shared the idea of exploring other Web3 publishing platforms like Mirro.xyz, while Kenichi talked about Paragraph.xyz and its potential. We’re looking to explore the power of Medium before we publish across multiple platforms.

Budget: We had discussions about the Q4 budget and projected timeframe for submitting the Q1 2025 budget proposal as well. With screensharing, Kenichi surfed the Treasury dashboard and tackled the budget discussion with Lady Tempestt by showcasing how much we have spent and how much we have left. Thankfully, Q4 is looking promising already, and we thought of adding some deliverables (such as the Indonesia X page), Zealy, and whether to allocate funds for graphics. Kenichi also hinted that the Marketing Guild’s Zealy campaign will start pretty soon.




#### Decision Items:
- We have decided that the Ecosystem Digests will be published every Saturday on the Substack to be followed suit with an announcement on X.

  - [**rationale**] In light of recent events, the SNET ecosystem has been making a lot of impact, and to this effect, news has been spreading around and we'd like to keep everyone updated so they don't miss out.

### Video Workgroup

- **Type of meeting:** Weekly
- **Present:** Zalfred [**facilitator**], Hogantuso [**documenter**], SubZero, Zalfred, Rojo, hogantuso, lilycupcake, AndrewBen, malik, Slate, LordKizzy, devon
- **Purpose:** Weekly meeting of the Video WorkGroup. The meeting focused on task updates and problems affecting the workgroup.
#### Discussion Points:
- A brief mention from Zalfred, as he will be facilitating the session also mentioned that the Vrewiev team approved two long videos, and three long videos are still in the review process.
- Rojo gave insight into the social media management role, going through the usual posts from the Town Halls and some shorts. He mentioned working on the mixpost platform to allow short clips to be posted. There was a problem with the TikTok posting, as it would be done manually from this device.
- Interaction discussions were made on the Abuon tus video and looking forward to updating the video document in the position, caption, main visual, and arrangement of shorts for a better clip 
- LordKizzy gave an update regarding the animation video for those who'd work on the animations for this month as we will be going for more shorts this month. We are looking into the engagements in these videos to come up with new plans and monthly plans on the subscription creating a mail for the five-man members making the editing. People should reach out to LordKizzy privately if they need access to the platform as it's a sensitive piece of information for non-members.  
- There were deliberations on the biweekly video from Lilycupcake who has raised issues about the review process, hearing her point of view and coming to an understanding in keeping up with the good work 

#### Decision Items:
- To decrease the number of long and increase the number of short videos as we are running to a tight budget.

#### Action Items:
- [**action**] Zalfred to move approved video to content sheet after the call  [**assignee**] Zalfred [**status**] todo
- [**action**] Rojo to come up with the new document for the video workgroup updates on the clips "HOW TO GO ABOUT IT" [**assignee**] rojo. [**status**] todo
