#### Narrative:
Kick-off: The weekly meeting of the WWG started with Kenichi welcoming everyone to November. Unfortunately, we couldn’t use “read.AI” to record our meeting. Cjfrankie introduced a new tool that might work better than read.AI “speechlogger.com.” 

We skimmed through the minutes from the last meeting and we kicked off from where we left off. Kenichi started by asking the WWG members whether we want to make an end-of-year recap and how we are going to do it! Cjfrankie suggested that using meeting summaries might help; Kenichi brought the idea of exporting articles and statistics from the SingularityNET Ambassadors Medium page.

What’s next for Medium: It is worth mentioning that the SNET Ambassadors Medium page has been able to amass 318 followers and surpass 1,000 views per post. Kenichi hinted that it’s time we run a partnership program where writers can get paid for their publications. Also, he mentioned the fact that reaching 1,000 followers would mean that we could run ads and content outreaches. Momentarily, Cjfrankie shared the idea of exploring other Web3 publishing platforms like Mirro.xyz, while Kenichi talked about Paragraph.xyz and its potential. We’re looking to explore the power of Medium before we publish across multiple platforms.

Budget: We had discussions about the Q4 budget and projected timeframe for submitting the Q1 2025 budget proposal as well. With screensharing, Kenichi surfed the Treasury dashboard and tackled the budget discussion with Lady Tempestt by showcasing how much we have spent and how much we have left. Thankfully, Q4 is looking promising already, and we thought of adding some deliverables (such as the Indonesia X page), Zealy, and whether to allocate funds for graphics. Kenichi also hinted that the Marketing Guild’s Zealy campaign will start pretty soon.




#### Decision Items:
- We have decided that the Ecosystem Digests will be published every Saturday on the Substack to be followed suit with an announcement on X.

  - [**rationale**] In light of recent events, the SNET ecosystem has been making a lot of impact, and to this effect, news has been spreading around and we'd like to keep everyone updated so they don't miss out.
