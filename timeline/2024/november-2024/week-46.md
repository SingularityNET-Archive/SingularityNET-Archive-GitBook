#### Narrative:
Kick-off:  The weekly WWG meeting started at 3:15 PM with a welcome greeting from Cjfrankie. We began by reviewing the action items from the last meeting, including the publication of the November 9 ecosystem digest on Substack (see https://snetambassadorprogram.substack.com/p/singularitynet-ecosystem-digest-november-197). Cjfrankie encouraged everyone to read, subscribe, and engage with the newsletter if they haven't already. 

Roblox Walkthrough: The meeting featured LordKizzy, OEP, and Devon — the Gamers' Guild members - asking questions about WWG to help them build the WWG workspace in their Roblox game of the Ambassador Program. With screen sharing, LordKizzy showcased the video workgroup modules and sections that have been built on Roblox; he also had some interaction with some of the WG members on the platform. The presentation was paramount and interesting indeed! It gave us an insider perspective of how the platform works and how the WWG will be built on Roblox. 
More on Roblox: Immediately, Devon took to the floor to ask the workgroup some questions like: 

‪What does the writer's workgroup do? Cjfrankie describes the WWG as a group of people passionate about writing who bring clarity to complex topics. We often use an 'explain like I’m five' (ELI5) approach in our articles to make them easier to understand.

‪What platforms do we use to publish our work? We make use of platforms like Medium and Substack.

‪What is our onboarding process like? Cjfrankie described the WWG onboarding process as a test-based process, where aspirants gain access through a simple text document. The scribblers (writers) then review the test, and if it meets the threshold, the aspirant receives the scribbler tag—that’s it!

‪Does the WWG pay for attending meetings? Cjfrankie clarified that scribblers earn points for attending meetings. Additionally, participating in WG activities like documentation and suggesting articles also allows Scribblers to accumulate points. These points are calculated at the end of the month, and the monetary value is then sent as a reward to the Scribbler.

Who is the WWG lead, and is there a form of hierarchy in the workgroup? ‘Kenichi, of course', said Cjfrankie. ‘The workgroup doesn’t have a strict hierarchy. After the lead, we have Scribes and Scribblers; no one is ruled over by another. The roles simply distinguish our responsibilities. For instance, Scribes have higher responsibilities and recurring tasks, while a Scribbler may suggest articles, write articles, and attend meetings', Cjfrankie added.

How do you want the WWG logo to be designed? Cjfrankie suggested that we have a logo of a book with a floating pen, which basically describes what the workgroup does. Gorga also mentioned that having a library would make a lot of sense, too. Last but certainly not least, we listed all the active members of the workgroup, namely Kenichi, Lady Tempestt, Mikasa, Cjfrankie, Ashley, Gorga, Ines, Devon, Slate, AJ, Emmanuel Isaac, Evelyn, and Eric Davis. 

Exploring Web3 Publishing Platforms: After the Gamers Guild completed their presentation, we had a short session on Web3 publishing tools. Emmanuel Isaac presented on Arweave, Mikasa shared documentation on Lens, Cjfrankie discussed Mirror, and Evelyn showcased Warpcast. The purpose of this research is to determine the next platform we should try out. We want to understand how they work, how DAOs can use them, and their pricing structures.

#### Discussion Points:
Task Manager Update (Tuso)
- A brief update from Tuso as he expressed his excitement on getting the role. He added that he hasn’t done much yet, besides setting up and bracing up for the month.

Social Management Update (Rojo)
- Updates from the Social Media Manager. Rojo announced that we’ve been posting out our regular videos and a couple of shorts and we’re doing pretty well on that.

- Rojo affirmed that the analytics have been quite stable although not much growth in the past days. 
- He added that there were no interactions on our Mastodon account so far. He suggested that we need to publicize our Mastodon account to the SNET community so we can get more interactions and push our contents further . 

Budget fitting and the Tier system 
- Lord Kizzy announced that the video workgroup will have to rule out a lot to fit into the new budget cap/tier system. He added that all recurring tasks will face a 15% cut, ruling out 10 short videos and 4 long videos, and there will be no room for new members in Quarter 1 2025. 

- Deliberations around the number of videos to be produced ( both long and shorts)

- Deliberations on what budget elements should stay and what’s to be  ruled out. 

Deliberations on changing the workgroup reward system:
- Malik suggested that our reward system be shifted to AGIX and not USD anymore.
- Rojo agreed to this adding that our workload could be rewarded hourly in Agix. 
- Many other concerns were raised concerning the implication of changing the workgroup reward system.
- Tuso and a few others opposed the motion of basing the rewarding system on AGIX, stating reasons as to why that should not stand:
1. The fluctuations of AGIX prices
2. ⁠The video WorkGroup might end up outrunning our allocations.
3. ⁠More work, less reward factor and others.

- LordKizzy and Malik stressed that the either way, the allocation wouldn’t be enough to cover the VWG operations.
- Malik opined that we could try rewarding our tasks both in USD and AGIX. LordKizzy commented on the complexities that will follow. He added that it would complicate things to the task manager and the treasury guild. 
- Although an inconclusive discussion, we resolved at holding a poll on the VWG channel to decide the fate of the house. 

 
Clarity on Osmium's ASI video proposal 
Deliberations on accepting Osmium's Video proposal
Kizzy added that due to the budget constraints, it might be an uphill battle at the moment.
The house agreed that Osmium's content be shared to the WorkGroup for a review and that will determine his rewards.
