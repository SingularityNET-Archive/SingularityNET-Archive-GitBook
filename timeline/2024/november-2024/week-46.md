Using our remaining leftover budgets we would like to allocate for reporting, proposing and updating core contributor list. In Quarter 4 we did not budget ourselves to cover other WG budgets. Marketing Guild disagreed to fund from their budget.

Update on Marketing Initiatives: CJ Frankie highlighted that there is no current update for now and they are still on it. Duke said that they need this to be completed before the end of this quarter.

Research on indigenous tooling: Onize stated that the research began in the last part of Q3 and is tailored to African needs to foster African engagement in the SingularityNet ecosystem and wider AI ecosystem. The research was carried out through a survey that was sent out to people both in and out of the sNET ecosystem to have a broad grasp. The major three issues raised were that 1) people needed more education on what AI was doing to mitigate their fear, 2) people wanted to see how advancing technology makes good health care and 3) people wanted to see how developers will use the tool to make advancing technology. The issue encountered doing the research is that a lot of people don't like to fill long surveys.
In conclusion, Onize suggested that we should focus on tools that will educate the public, tools that will help health care professionals and we should create co-pilot assistance that would help developers and the public at large in an African way.
Duke appreciated the team but noted that the recommendation suggested was good but generic, and that the Guild is looking for recommendations for tools that African Guild can create which will benefit the SingularityNet ecosystem.

Tool update by Advanceameyaw: Advanceameyaw explained that tool explores on numbers. He said that math is everything; we know famous AI tools like chatGPT but the other aspect we don't know, like mathematical models involved in it. This tool aims at bringing simplicity to the whole numbers and mathematical concern. He noted how math started from Africa by the Egyptians and we have to get to the core of our foundation. It will help our understanding and without mathematics there is no understanding of the universe.

Q4 A.M.A Session Update: Onize said that they have reached out to the speakers and have sent them their itinerary and the date as being fixed for 29th November, 2024. Duke noted that the A.M.A is for everyone both in and out of the ambassador program and he encouraged us to invite our friends. 

We welcomed new members and introductions were made. 

Q1 2025 budget: Duke said that there is a consensus in Governance WG to have a system of tiered budget caps in the new quarter with the intention to help us mitigate the delay usually experienced in the budget consent and budget fitting process. So the African guild was initially given a cap of 8,500 AGIX which is equivalent to 5,270 US dollars at the selected exchange rate of $0.55. Due to the budget allocated we will need to focus more on operational tasks such as our recurring weekly meting tasks; our project and workshop sessions; and others. Duke has requested an additional 1,500 AGIX to increase the total to 10,000 AGIX, but it is still pending. The finalized budget fitting will be presented to the Treasury before the 25th of November.

AOB: Tee inquired about the research document, expressing interest to follow-up in the research. Duke said that the research has been concluded and also noted that we are taking a bit of a slow down on conducting more research because we have already done quite a number of researches in the pipeline. And we are now full blown into our implementation phase. So all of the outputs that we have already gathered from our previous quarter research will now be used in Q1 of 2025 where we are now implementing.

- **Working Docs:**
  - [Lens Presentation ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13akxlCysoVskjzMITTl8rK3WnJwTWGUkhi78VF_scUo/edit)

#### Narrative:
Kick-off:  The weekly WWG meeting started at 3:15 PM with a welcome greeting from Cjfrankie. We began by reviewing the action items from the last meeting, including the publication of the November 9 ecosystem digest on Substack (see https://snetambassadorprogram.substack.com/p/singularitynet-ecosystem-digest-november-197). Cjfrankie encouraged everyone to read, subscribe, and engage with the newsletter if they haven't already. 

Roblox Walkthrough: The meeting featured LordKizzy, OEP, and Devon â the Gamers' Guild members - asking questions about WWG to help them build the WWG workspace in their Roblox game of the Ambassador Program. With screen sharing, LordKizzy showcased the video workgroup modules and sections that have been built on Roblox; he also had some interaction with some of the WG members on the platform. The presentation was paramount and interesting indeed! It gave us an insider perspective of how the platform works and how the WWG will be built on Roblox. 
More on Roblox: Immediately, Devon took to the floor to ask the workgroup some questions like: 

âªWhat does the writer's workgroup do? Cjfrankie describes the WWG as a group of people passionate about writing who bring clarity to complex topics. We often use an 'explain like Iâm five' (ELI5) approach in our articles to make them easier to understand.

âªWhat platforms do we use to publish our work? We make use of platforms like Medium and Substack.

âªWhat is our onboarding process like? Cjfrankie described the WWG onboarding process as a test-based process, where aspirants gain access through a simple text document. The scribblers (writers) then review the test, and if it meets the threshold, the aspirant receives the scribbler tagâthatâs it!

âªDoes the WWG pay for attending meetings? Cjfrankie clarified that scribblers earn points for attending meetings. Additionally, participating in WG activities like documentation and suggesting articles also allows Scribblers to accumulate points. These points are calculated at the end of the month, and the monetary value is then sent as a reward to the Scribbler.

Who is the WWG lead, and is there a form of hierarchy in the workgroup? âKenichi, of course', said Cjfrankie. âThe workgroup doesnât have a strict hierarchy. After the lead, we have Scribes and Scribblers; no one is ruled over by another. The roles simply distinguish our responsibilities. For instance, Scribes have higher responsibilities and recurring tasks, while a Scribbler may suggest articles, write articles, and attend meetings', Cjfrankie added.

How do you want the WWG logo to be designed? Cjfrankie suggested that we have a logo of a book with a floating pen, which basically describes what the workgroup does. Gorga also mentioned that having a library would make a lot of sense, too. Last but certainly not least, we listed all the active members of the workgroup, namely Kenichi, Lady Tempestt, Mikasa, Cjfrankie, Ashley, Gorga, Ines, Devon, Slate, AJ, Emmanuel Isaac, Evelyn, and Eric Davis. 

Exploring Web3 Publishing Platforms: After the Gamers Guild completed their presentation, we had a short session on Web3 publishing tools. Emmanuel Isaac presented on Arweave, Mikasa shared documentation on Lens, Cjfrankie discussed Mirror, and Evelyn showcased Warpcast. The purpose of this research is to determine the next platform we should try out. We want to understand how they work, how DAOs can use them, and their pricing structures.



#### Action Items:
- [**action**] Kenichi is to finalize the Q4 report before the next meeting, as we are only a few weeks from the deadline. [**assignee**] kenichi [**due**] 22 November 2024 [**status**] done
- [**action**] Mikasa will follow up with Cjfrankie to discuss the unification of the content calendar from the Marketing Guild.
 [**assignee**] Mikasa [**due**] 22 November 2024 [**status**] done

#### Learning Points:
- Mirror, Lens, Warpcast, and Arweave as Web3 publishing platforms for DAOs to take publishing to the next level.

- Roblox Studio is used for creating, designing, and scripting interactive 3D games and experiences within the Roblox platform.

#### Discussion Points:
Task Manager Update (Tuso)
- A brief update from Tuso as he expressed his excitement on getting the role. He added that he hasnât done much yet, besides setting up and bracing up for the month.

Social Management Update (Rojo)
- Updates from the Social Media Manager. Rojo announced that weâve been posting out our regular videos and a couple of shorts and weâre doing pretty well on that.

- Rojo affirmed that the analytics have been quite stable although not much growth in the past days. 
- He added that there were no interactions on our Mastodon account so far. He suggested that we need to publicize our Mastodon account to the SNET community so we can get more interactions and push our contents further . 

Budget fitting and the Tier system 
- Lord Kizzy announced that the video workgroup will have to rule out a lot to fit into the new budget cap/tier system. He added that all recurring tasks will face a 15% cut, ruling out 10 short videos and 4 long videos, and there will be no room for new members in Quarter 1 2025. 

- Deliberations around the number of videos to be produced ( both long and shorts)

- Deliberations on what budget elements should stay and whatâs to be  ruled out. 

Deliberations on changing the workgroup reward system:
- Malik suggested that our reward system be shifted to AGIX and not USD anymore.
- Rojo agreed to this adding that our workload could be rewarded hourly in Agix. 
- Many other concerns were raised concerning the implication of changing the workgroup reward system.
- Tuso and a few others opposed the motion of basing the rewarding system on AGIX, stating reasons as to why that should not stand:
1. The fluctuations of AGIX prices
2. â The video WorkGroup might end up outrunning our allocations.
3. â More work, less reward factor and others.

- LordKizzy and Malik stressed that the either way, the allocation wouldnât be enough to cover the VWG operations.
- Malik opined that we could try rewarding our tasks both in USD and AGIX. LordKizzy commented on the complexities that will follow. He added that it would complicate things to the task manager and the treasury guild. 
- Although an inconclusive discussion, we resolved at holding a poll on the VWG channel to decide the fate of the house. 

 
Clarity on Osmium's ASI video proposal 
Deliberations on accepting Osmium's Video proposal
Kizzy added that due to the budget constraints, it might be an uphill battle at the moment.
The house agreed that Osmium's content be shared to the WorkGroup for a review and that will determine his rewards.

#### Discussion Points:
- Mascot Design Voting Transparency: Ayo emphasized the importance of ensuring transparent access to voting results for the mascot design competition.

- Zealot Publicity: Ese announced that publicity efforts for the Zealot initiative would commence on Monday.

- Marketing Budget Cap and Tiers: Kizzy presented the current budget cap, highlighting the limited allocation to the Marketing Guild â approximately half of the proposed amount. He also criticized the guild's lack of involvement in governance meetings.
Ashley suggested that the budget cap should be reviewed and adjusted regularly to ensure alignment with priorities.
Ayo proposed merging some guilds to optimize resource allocation and collaboration.

- Guild Membership Redundancy: Kizzy pointed out the issue of redundancy within the Marketing Guild and suggested removing inactive members to improve efficiency.

- Ops taskforce & facilitator reward: Ayo raised the need to review ops taskforce and facilitator's reward to ensure it aligns with his contributions.

#### Decision Items:
- It was decided that the budget allocation process will be revised to discontinue auto-payments for members who show minimal or no participation in the Marketing Guild, ensuring funds are better utilized to support active contributors and initiatives.
  - [**rationale**] Given the Marketing Guild's already limited funds, it is essential to optimize resource allocation. Discontinuing auto-payments for members with minimal or no participation ensures that the available budget is directed toward active contributors and impactful initiatives. This approach enhances productivity, maintains accountability, and maximizes the effectiveness of the guild's limited financial resources.

- [**action**] Kareem to provide clarification on the mascot design voting process, ensuring transparency and access to results for all members. [**assignee**] kareem [**status**] todo
- [**action**] Marketing Guild to present the budget cap discussion to the larger house for consensus and alignment on fund allocation strategies. [**assignee**] all members [**status**] todo
