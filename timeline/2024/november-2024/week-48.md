#### Narrative:
Kick-off: The writers' workgroup's weekly meeting started about 15 minutes past 3 o’clock. Kenichi welcomed everyone as usual and highlighted the reason we couldn’t join the call earlier — the marketing guild call was still ongoing! 

Exploring Web3 Publishing Platforms:  Momentarily, we delved into how we can move forward with our publications. Cjfrankie shared some of the research documents from the last two meetings. And we talked about how we can expand. Then Ines discussed getting some graphics for the recent article she wrote “The Consciousness Explosion,” which is around 19 minutes long. Kenichi added that he would edit the draft and schedule it for publication, while Gorga volunteered to make some graphics for the draft. 

Budget Cap: Before now, we had so many views for Q1 2025, however, there’s a limit to what we can do — we hope AGIX pumps. This led to Gorga asking about the Indonesian page he proposed in Q3 2024. Kenichi cleared the air by saying that we’re at the limit of our agreed 10,500 AGIX budget cap, so we have removed items on our Q1 2025 budget so that we don’t go over budget. He added that new initiatives might not be able to come in, including the Indonesian page. He also discussed the importance of getting a separate wallet to enable the WWG to swap the budget to stablecoin, and reward writers with AGIX instead of USD-based rewards. Nonetheless, he added that the page can be created now, but it will have little attention. 

Twitter Premium: Kenichi hinted that the writers' workgroup cannot get metrics from the Spanish page and the Pidgin page because we do not have any premium plans. He added that any page with 1,000 followers on X (formerly Twitter) will get a premium account, and the allocation for managing these pages will be different. 

Monthly Stats: As we say goodbye to November 2024, we reflected on our journey since the beginning of the quarter. We glanced through all the social media accounts (X, Substack, Medium) to see how they performed in November, and the numbers and stats were quite impressive. We also revisited our Q4 2024 report to see if there are any changes we can make. 

SingularityNET Ambassador community: Kenichi introduced the new SNET community launched on X. He hinted that the page is up and running, and he encouraged everyone to join the community including the social media managers, so he can make them moderators. From a bird’s-eye view, the community is built to unite, empower, and celebrate the SNET ambassador community by connecting and sharing knowledge. Lastly, he added that there should be more interaction on X by replying to questions from community members. As a matter of finality, Kenichi said that the points system rewards for November would go out next week on Tuesday, and he urged every writer to check the boxes.

### Video Workgroup

- **Type of meeting:** Weekly
- **Present:** Malik [**facilitator**], Zalfred [**documenter**], SubZero, Zalfred, Rojo, hogantuso, AndrewBen, malik, LordKizzy, killy, oep, devon, osmium, Slate
- **Purpose:** Weekly meeting of the Video WorkGroup. The purpose of this meeting was to discuss the activities of the video workgroup and possibly get an alternative social media automation tool; secondly, to resolve misunderstandings that transpired in the workgroup; and lastly, find solutions to the issue of uploading large files.
#### Discussion Points:
- 
Update from Tuso, our Task Manager: Tuso gave a quick update on the  various tasks he assigned to  different members in the previous week, covering video submissions, etc.

Update from Rojo, our Social Media Manager: Rojo gave a brief update on the activities on our social media platforms, stating that he posted out our regular videos. He also addressed the issue of a missing Town Hall video and the issue of late Town Hall Video submissions.

We discussed alternative social media automation tool (Zaps) and possible solutions to the issue of how it handles large files

We resolved an interpersonal dispute that transpired in the workgroup's Discord channel 


#### Decision Items:
- Malik suggested that Zaps (part of Zapier) would be a great automation tool for scheduling and automatically posting out our Town Hall Video edits on time
  - [**opposing**] Rojo added that there are quite a few limitations to Zaps (an automation tool) as the file size that the software can handle is limited. 

Rojo suggested that the Town Hall video editors could edit and upload Town Hall videos as fast as possible, and on the question of large video sizes, he added that compressing these videos will help mitigate the problem. 
He added that sometimes our Town Hall video sizes are as large as 5GB and so compressing these videos will be a great idea
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- Concerns were raised about video quality, but Rojo reaffirmed that compressing these videos will not have any negative effect on the video quality.
  - [**rationale**] As the workgroup is quite aware that quality visual content is our top priority, Rojo added that compressing the background picture or templates of the Town Hall video before editing the zoom video into the template will solve this problem.
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- Resolving the interpersonal dispute or misunderstanding that transpired in the workgroup's Discord the previous week.
  - [**rationale**] Those present at this meeting felt that it was simply a case of misunderstandings and misinformation between affected parties. However, one of the parties was not present today, so Rojo was assigned to reach out to them to try and resolve the underlying dispute.
