  - [Starter document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14ibt8g356vB320x_lDgE80UpervzQHayGPFpJpRcdJo/)

#### Narrative:
We addressed who will be part of core contributors - Vani said this often happens organically by starting channel and see who turns up.
We talked about how the Archives workgroup in Ambassadors has started an AI ethics/strategy  policy. This led to a discussion about how the ecosystem could apply ethics and safety. This could take the form of local groups set within a broader, ecosystemwide ethics committee, so that there's coherence but also focused attention within groups, and freedom to do it according to their needs. Some ethics needs will be different.

We talked about how the Global Ethics Initiative fits in the Risk Management Framework. Specifically, gathering information from ecosystem groups, and collating general ethics research and information. It was suggested that setting standards for the Marketplace could ensure that spinoffs apply it (thought that's only effective if they care about getting on the Marketplace). We agreed to set up a common resource spreadsheet to start to gather research information and frameworks.


We discussed how the new LATAM Guild can get involved in the Global Ethics Initiative. They could translate survey into Spanish and distribute. Maybe the Foundation funding can contribute to that.
Ambassadors could have a presence at AI for Good and/or AGI and continue the fishbowl interviews (discussed proper ethics and informed consent form, and collecting metadata/contextual data

Thousands of dollars were allocated to development, but not a single repo is shared nor seems to be developed. All we get is a Proposal for Q2. I trust the members to be more transparent with deliverables in Q2 or I might become a blocker" as invalid since the guild decides on how to give out deliverables to the community.
- Discussions on Concerns in our Q2 budget. majority of the members, "My only concern is that as the projects and initiatives increase in this Guild we have not properly addressed the Operations increase that is impacted by that. As the iniatives grow there are more and more operations and internal processes that are not accurately captured by the budget." : we have agreed to improve our workflow in terms of Operations.
