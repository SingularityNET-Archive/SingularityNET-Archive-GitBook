### AI Ethics WG

- Type of meeting: Biweekly
- Present: Esther [facilitator], Esther [documenter], Vanessa, Peter, 5oundwave5, Esther, Duke, LeeLoo, Guillermo
- Purpose: To form initial conversations about the GEI (Global Ethics Initiative) workgroup, overall purpose, and some initial strategy.
- Meeting video: [Link](No video)
- Transcript: [Link](No transcript)
- Working Docs:
  - [GEI Budget proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nSifu3pDc--ZzZ91QvTQ0y1ALbkxZ5r7erEzsT82UF0/)
  - [Starter document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14ibt8g356vB320x_lDgE80UpervzQHayGPFpJpRcdJo/)

#### Narrative:
We addressed who will be part of core contributors - Vani said this often happens organically by starting channel and see who turns up.
We talked about how the Archives workgroup in Ambassadors has started an AI ethics/strategy  policy. This led to a discussion about how the ecosystem could apply ethics and safety. This could take the form of local groups set within a broader, ecosystemwide ethics committee, so that there's coherence but also focused attention within groups, and freedom to do it according to their needs. Some ethics needs will be different.

We talked about how the Global Ethics Initiative fits in the Risk Management Framework. Specifically, gathering information from ecosystem groups, and collating general ethics research and information. It was suggested that setting standards for the Marketplace could ensure that spinoffs apply it (thought that's only effective if they care about getting on the Marketplace). We agreed to set up a common resource spreadsheet to start to gather research information and frameworks.


We discussed how the new LATAM Guild can get involved in the Global Ethics Initiative. They could translate survey into Spanish and distribute. Maybe the Foundation funding can contribute to that.
Ambassadors could have a presence at AI for Good and/or AGI and continue the fishbowl interviews (discussed proper ethics and informed consent form, and collecting metadata/contextual data

#### Town Hall Summary:
Main topics this Town Hall include:

- the idea of reviving Strategy Guild, the things it did in the past (including testing of decision-making tools), and brief opinions on why it faded. (Note from the meeting Chat - Ways to find out what a group has done in the past are their past budgets; their archived meeting summaries; and their Discord.)

- In-depth discussion of open source ethos and culture. Open-source is more than just tools and licences; Open-source also is meant to prevent hidden changes or functionality; "open source" doesn't have to mean working for free, getting ripped off, etc; Open-source is a very specific culture, originally - but has it expnded beyond its original limits?; Do we need to pay more attention to open-source approaches in our work?; Archives' work on how to open-source our documents; idea of building our own open-source tooling, and only using 3rd-party tools temporarily; listing the tools we do use (and note this was done in the past - see "Grassroots Ethics of the SNET Ambassador Program", https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DOO2TKNkLBKSFFa5jvgAHm30wjNpRj0uXiVz6YRtI9E/edit?usp=sharing , which is an outline of tools used in the Program and the ethics behind them, created October 2023 by Incubation Guild; and "Ambassador Tools" https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hFAp0dm5Tmoh29EgxC9r5XTey_EWeb9lRdrI0JCpbPk/edit?usp=sharing , a list of tools used and how they are used in the Program.

Budget changement at Writers' WG causes some confusion. We will reach out to the Writers WG to ask for a re-submission and clarity on the current Q2 Budget proposal. We ideally get a updated Writers WG budget submitted by Monday, May 13th

Issues:
Not clear how to contact Core Contributors the best, so we set up a new channel ("Decision To Be Made") which will be publicly accessible, but with writing access only for the core contributors. We will announce important topics regarding decisions which need to be made at that channel.

- [action] Define format for a retrospective session on Q2 budget decisionmaking. We will use two parallel processes to gather feedback & insights on the Q2 Budget. First, we organise a Zoom session, supporting with a Miro board. Make the round and ask core contributors about: What worked well, didnt worked well & suggestions for improvements. We plan to host the retrospective session on June 11th at 14.00 UTC at the Governance WG. [assignee] all [due] 11 June 2024 [status] todo

Thousands of dollars were allocated to development, but not a single repo is shared nor seems to be developed. All we get is a Proposal for Q2. I trust the members to be more transparent with deliverables in Q2 or I might become a blocker" as invalid since the guild decides on how to give out deliverables to the community.
- Discussions on Concerns in our Q2 budget. majority of the members, "My only concern is that as the projects and initiatives increase in this Guild we have not properly addressed the Operations increase that is impacted by that. As the iniatives grow there are more and more operations and internal processes that are not accurately captured by the budget." : we have agreed to improve our workflow in terms of Operations.
