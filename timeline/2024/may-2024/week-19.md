#### Discussion Points:
- Discussions on R&D Guild Budget and Duke's proposal ( Research on Inclusivity for Individuals with Disabilities in SingularityNET Ecosystem.): this wont be included in our Q2 budget, due to an increase in proposals from workgroups and intergration of new workgroups
- Discussions on Concerns in our Q2 budget. majority of the members, found the first concern "There is huge concern between Q1 proposal and Quarterly results match. Thousands of dollars were allocated to development, but not a single repo is shared nor seems to be developed. All we get is a Proposal for Q2. I trust the members to be more transparent with deliverables in Q2 or I might become a blocker" as invalid since the guild decides on how to give out deliverables to the community.
- Discussions on Concerns in our Q2 budget. majority of the members, "My only concern is that as the projects and initiatives increase in this Guild we have not properly addressed the Operations increase that is impacted by that. As the iniatives grow there are more and more operations and internal processes that are not accurately captured by the budget." : we have agreed to improve our workflow in terms of Operations.
