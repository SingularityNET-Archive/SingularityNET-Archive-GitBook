#### Decision Items:
- Stephen showed April and May work on colab development.  
  - [rationale] Straightforward semantic searches are returning correct results, though it needs some refinement to get it into more human language; next step will be prompt creation.
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- Open Source Strategy issue (see https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/139) contains a lot of different work elements, and will eventually need breaking up - although we're not quite ready to separate it out yet.
  - [rationale] Needs breaking up so we can track the discrete tasks that it comprises (for example, RAG retrieval process; development of AI Ethics strategy doc; sharing our approach to open source licencing; etc)
  - [opposing] but the issues are all quite interconnected, so it is useful to keep them together for a little while longer
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- On open-source document management, Andre has identified how to work with text changes to a google doc, and how to extract resolved comments and update text changes to the doc in the repo itself
  - [rationale] Next steps will be identifying headings; and automating turning the text into markdown; ultimately to use it as part of the source material for an LLM to search.
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- We clarified the distiction between Stephen's LLM work and Ubio's this quarter
  - [rationale] Stephen focusing on extraction and interpretation of data using natural language; Ubio looking at categorisation, tagging, sentiment analysis; and comparing/assessing different models.
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- Meeting Summary tool development this month - cancelled or "no summary given" meetings are now saving properly to the database; an automation has been created to dump all the summarires into the repo; and a summary template for the new AI Ethics WG has been added
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- The data dump of meeting summaries only includes links to any linked docs. A next step is to create some kind of document manager tool that will extract the text and create a dump of that too

#### Agenda item 3 - R&D Guild Proposal budget changes on the last minute - [carry over]

#### Discussion Points:
- The wrong budget may have been consented to on the consent forms. We cannot tell if people were looking at and consenting to the total given in the Budget Calculator google sheet, or the updated total in the Guild's actual budget, which included Duke Peter's proposal for a project looking at barriers due to disability.

#### Decision Items:
- It was mistakenly recorded in the meeting summary video that we had agreed not to update the budget to the new total that was submitted just before the deadline. But in fact, the meeting agreed to raise this issue for further discussion in a future meeting.
  - [rationale] R&D's budget was updated before the deadline, and the majority felt that the updated version is what people are likely to have been looking at, so the additional budget item should stand.
  - [opposing]  Some felt that people might have been consenting to the older total given in the Budget Calculator, which was lower
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople

#### Action Items:
- [action] this issue will be discussed in a future meeting [assignee] all [due] 30 May 2024 [status] todo

#### Keywords/tags:
