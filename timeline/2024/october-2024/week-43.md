#### Narrative:
1) Should we continue using Consent as our decision-making methodology for the decsion on Q1 2025 budgets? After discussion, we concluded yes (see "Decisions" below), but possibly with adaptations, and definitely with a commitment to looking into other methodologies in time for the Q2 2025 budget decision.

2) Should we include the possibility of delegation (i.e. Core Contributors who don't want to take part fully could delegate their decision-making power to another core contributor this time? On balance, we decided no (see "Decisions").

3) What should be the timeline for the decision on Q1 2025 budgets? We based it on the timeline for Q4 2024, but allowed for a Christmas break starting c. Fri 13th Dec; and we removed the initial iteration where people just say whether or not they consent to each budget, because our last  retrospective showed that it didn't work well. So our agreed timeline is:

        - WGs submit Q1 budgets and Q4 reports by Mon 25th Nov
	- Core Contributors submit their consent forms by Mon 2nd Dec
	- Discussion of objections takes place in Governance call on Tues 3rd Dec
	- WGs submit adjusted budgets in response to objections by Sun 8th Dec
	- 2nd-round consent forms are shared on Mon 9th December
	- Core Contributors submit their 2nd-round consent forms by Wed 11th Dec
	- Discuss and finalise in the OpenGov call on Thur 12th Dec.

We noted that this timeline means that WGs will be reporting on their Q4 work before the work is fully completed; so we agreed that WGs will be asked to report on October and November, with projections for how they expect their work to be finalised in December.



#### Decision Items:
- We decided to continue to use a Consent methodology to make the decision on Q1 2025 budgets.
  - [**rationale**] Although several people in the meeting said they would prefer to stop using Consent and try something else, overall it was felt that people are not yet sufficiently well informed about other methods of decision-making to select a new approach at this stage. 

We also noted that the problems that have been identified with the decision-making process in Q3 and Q4 may not be due to the "consent" method itself, but to not using the method properly; so we should make the Q1 2025 decision more definitely a "consent" process.
  - [**opposing**] Several people said they would prefer to move away from Consent as a methodology. It was noted that Consent was only adopted as an experiment, so we need to stay open to the possibility of trying a new experiment at some point. 
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We decided that although Consent will continue to be used for the Q1 2025 budget decision, we commit to starting soon to look into other methodologies, so we can make an informed decision about whether to change to a new method in time for the Q2 2025 budget decision.
  - [**rationale**] Because, in order to decide on a change to our decision methodology, there would ideally need to be a proposal on the table about *which* new method to use; and this could only develop after discussing several options.

We also noted that if we change the method without addressing underlying issues that have been identified in retrospective sessions, they will only resurface later. 
  - [**opposing**] None.
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We agreed *not* to use delegation as part of the decisionmaking process for Q1 2025 budgets. 
  - [**rationale**] Several reasons - 
1) It shifts the process away from "consent" and towards something more like a vote. It was suggested that if we want to move to voting, we should make an overt decision to do so, rather than introducing elements that turn it into a vote without a decision to do so.
2) People canvassing for delegates was felt to be an unappealing idea, and also open to corruption - people could promise favours for delegating to them, or threaten repercussions for not doing so. A governance process should not rest on trust that "Nobody here would do that", but should be designed to be robust and safe even if people did.
3) It perhaps only gives an illusion of increased participation and engagement with governance. Delegating one's decision-making power can mean abdicating responsibility.
  - [**opposing**] Delegation could offer a way for people's voices to be heard even if they don't have time or energy to complete consent forms.
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We agreed that given we are not using delegation, we should in future sessions discuss other ways to address the issues that delegation was intended to address - specifically, enabling people's voices to be heard even if they do not take part in completing a consent form
  - [**rationale**] because fully engaging in the consent process is quite demanding of people's time and energy, and not everyone is able to do it - and it's important to consider ways for them to nevertheless have a voice.
  - [**opposing**] None.
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We agreed on a timeline for the Q1 2025 budget decision process - see "meeting narrative" above
  - [**rationale**] Starting on Nov 25th, and omitting the initial "no-detail" consent round, should make it possible to conclude in time for the Christmas break.
  - [**opposing**] None.
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We agreed that WGs will be asked to report on October and November only, with projections (where applicable) for how they expect their work to be finalised in December.
  - [**rationale**] because if WGs are submitting quarterly reports on Nov 25th, some of their Q4 work is likely to not yet be complete.
  - [**opposing**] None.
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople

### Writers Workgroup

- **Type of meeting:** Weekly
- **Present:** Kenichi [**facilitator**], Cjfrankie  [**documenter**], Kenichi, cjfrankie, LadyTempestt, Gorga Siagian, Mikasa, AJ, Evelyn Robert, Eric Davis, AJ, AshleyDawn, advanceameyaw
- **Purpose:** Weekly meeting of the writers' workgroup.
- **Working Docs:**
  - [DRAFT: Budget Proposals Sheet: Q1, 2025 Writers Workgroup ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XDAPSG9y4U8nhQWQgrok3Z6pG9vsbfYPIMD7gISBJo0/edit?usp=sharing)

#### Narrative:
Kick-off: The weekly meeting of the WWG started at 3:10 PM with a warm welcome greeting from Kenichi. Immediately, we surfed the Dework board to check out some tasks in progress, and then Kenichi mentioned that he would assign deadlines to the DWeb3 series threads. He also started a conversation around the ecosystem page and the community page, noting that no article has been published on the community page since the 1st of October. Momentarily, he hinted that we should have an end-of-the-year recap draft, covering the entire achievement and milestones of the WWG in a year. He also talked about the successful Twin Protocol token launch on Uniswap, and suggested that the WWG should write something to publicize it.

Budget: There is now less money in the proposed Q4 budget, because some Q3 tasks were paid from the Q4 budget. In light of this, Kenichi said that he’ll fit the Q4 budget. This discussion led to Kenichi’s suggestion to shift from USD-based payments to AGIX-based payments. Lady Tempestt commented that AGIX-based payments will result in members being underpaid. Kenichi quickly responded that the WWG is not shifting its focus to AGIX-based rewards; rather, rewards will be sent based on AGIX calculations, since AGIX’s price isn’t stable! This way, we can streamline our budget spending so it doesn’t affect the workgroup, which can make us run out of funds.

Open Discussion: Cjfrankie and Kenichi started a thrilling conversation on how the ambassador program can explore new things to leapfrog to greater heights. We shared some potential ideas on possible initiatives that can motivate the foundation, which can lead to funding. Due to some recent events, the African Guild, LatAm, and four articles from the WWG were spotlighted by the SNET Foundation, so we should give them more reasons to support the ambassador program. We also shed light on how some Web3 communities are doing great things out


#### Decision Items:
- As the year wraps up, we look forward to Q1 2025. In light of such, we shall begin discussions about the Q1 2025 budget on the 1st of November.
  - [**rationale**] We want to speed things up so won't lag.
