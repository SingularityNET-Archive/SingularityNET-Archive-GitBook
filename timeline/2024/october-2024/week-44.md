  - [Onboarding Journeys Quick Survey](https://forms.gle/VcQVJAoXtYa1ukB77)
  - [Skills database form](https://skillsdatabase-21b11771237e.herokuapp.com/members/members-list/)

#### In this meeting we discussed:
- We agreed the minutes of the last meeting. 
Vani raised the point that if corrections are made to a summary by WG members, then the documenter needs to make the relevant changes when they add the summary to the meeting summary tool. (In the last meeting summary, the documenter unfortunately didn't do this.)


- Skillshare matrix: The regular call-out for members to add their skills to the skillshare matrix, both the ones they intend to learn and the ones they currently have.
- Onboarding Journeys: As an extension of the work on Onboarding Journeys, Onize has created and shared a Googleform ("Onboarding Journeys Quick Survey") to ask people in the Ambassador Program about their own onboarding journeys, and any barriers they have faced. There has been only 1 response so far, but it was interesting - the person "felt all alone and had to catch up with the Ambassador's program's purpose which honestly doesn't feel completely clear yet". So we need to think about how we will address issues that come up in the form; and we also need to keep sharing it. We agreed the Onboarding Focus Group will look at this when they meet tomorrow; and Onize will keep sharing the form every now and then.

- Onboarding Journeys: Lord Kizzy suggested having monthly/quarterly surveys tackling challenges facing new members.
- Research on decentralisation: Kateri briefly discussed the research that she and Ayo are working on. They will be asking their questions in small-group interviews, which will be recorded. We agreed that we'd like to see a little more info on the planned research methodology (e.g. how interviewees will be selected; how the interviewers will ensure a valid and ethical approach).

- Potential collab with R&D Guild: We discussed a collaboration with R&D Guild on skills info - i.e. their Collaboration Skills Database and our Skillshare Matrix.  

Questions were raised on the use of the term "soft skills/hard skills" in R&D's database, which some people find quite dismissive of the range of "non-developer" skills; and we discussed whether the work that Onboarding has done in our Skillshare Matrix on describing and defining different non-developer skills might be useful. 

Advanceameyaw and Lord Kizzy, as members of R&D Guild, said R&D intends that the info in the database could be used by Onboarding in signposting new people to tasks and WGs that suit their skills. Some concerns were raised about whether this connects with Onboarding's existing processes, and whether the Collaboration Skills Database info is in a useful format: the Database currently uses a lot of free text, which can take time to interpret; and we queried whether controlled vocabs would be better and would give more usable info. We also noted that if this was done, then "non-developer" skills would need to be defined in ways that make sense to people who actually have those skills; we noted that previous iterations of the Database, which *did* use controlled vocabs, didn't really succeed in this.

Questions were also raised on privacy and data protection issues: AdvanceAmeyaw noted that these have been considered, but Vani said they may not have been been considered thoroughly enough. 

We agreed that a dedicated meeting between Onboarding and R&D would be useful.
- Marketing WG is asking for 2 people from each WG to be responsible for adding material to their new Content Calendar - so if a WG needs any marketing or promotional material to be produced, they add it to the calendar, and Marketing will produce it. We agreed the Onboarding Focus Group will select 2 people when they meet tomorrow.

#### Decision Items:
- R&D will consider not using the ‚Äòhard skills/soft skills‚Äô terminology in the in the Collaboration Skills Database
  - [**rationale**] The term can be unclear (people vary on what they define as a "hard/soft skill"; and the terms can be experienced as somewhat dismissive.
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- The 2 forthcoming skillshare sessions (Monitoring and Evaluation on 21st Nov; Decentralised Governance on 5th Dec) are to be publicized with an infographic.
  - [**rationale**] Presenting both sessions on one infographic means less work, and also shows that it's a "program" of skillshare sessions, not just a couple of random one-offs.
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We noted that the skillshare session on Monitoring and Evaluation is on Thurs 21st Nov, not 25th Nov 
  - [**rationale**] It has previously been recorded in error in meeting summaries as 25th Nov.
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople

#### Narrative:
Kickoff: The African guild meeting began at 5:10 PM with Clement welcoming everyone and giving the reason why Duke is not available in today's meeting. Isaac Daniel was meant to be our documenter, but he was unavailable, so MartinSoki opted to step in. We glanced over the minutes from the last meeting summary; no one had any reservations. 

Tripartite Partnership with African Guild: We had this partnership conversation in Q3 and now we are finalizing it, we are trying to work on the blueprint document. So, the African Guild is going to strike a partnership with three organizations, REMOSTART (https://www.remostarts.com/), STARHIVE (https://starhive.com/), and BETA AFRICA (https://beta.africa/). REMOSTART will be coming in as a technical partner - we are doing a lot of research and right now we are moving into actual development phases. STARHIVE comes in as a research partner, and we have BETA AFRICA as an educational partner. We are going to have these partnerships that will quest static over the period for which we will have a promotion of these AI tools that our team of brilliant people who are actually carrying out current research on how to work around this. We will be sending out letters to describe actual involvement and what we expect from them. We will bring it up here for everyone to have a more in-depth knowledge of when and where the boundaries for involvement are for us as a Guild and for them as independent organizations.    

Updates from Research on Indigenous Tooling: Onize said they are making progress on collecting responses but so far, they have had just one. She asked for more time so they can collect more data. Clement suggested reminding people via DM to give responses, as well as posting in the Discord channel; and tagging people by name in the channel. Onize agreed.

Q4 A.M.A Session Update: Ese said they need to conclude on the speakers, and then they can start to publicise it. |The date is November 29th, 2024. Ese gave more detail on the event: that over time we have been discussing the need to Africanize AI tools, it is for Africa to step up their game. The focus of this A.M.A is practical action items to enable us to do all that we have discussed.

Update on Marketing Initiatives: Ese said the marketing team are planning two initiatives, and will discuss with the Focus Group about implementing them - will it be in Q4, or in Q1 2025? The 2 initiatives are:

- UGC (user-generated content) on a theme of cultural perspectives on the sNET ASI Alliance, i.e people from different places, creating images inspired by what they think of when they hear "ASI". There will be three winners. Ese will share the documentation by the weekend with the focus group before sharing it with the whole SNET community. Timescale: two weeks, so if it's approved then it should be happening the second week of November.

- a Pan African Mega SingularityNet X space, with all the team being inside Africa. A way to onboard startups and AI builders into the SingularityNET platform. Aim to onboard about 10 companies to join the discussion, who do not yet have anything to do with SingularityNET but are building AI based solutions. Timescale: first week of December. 

Discussion on Contest and Community Engagement: Ese is thinking of taking it outside the Ambassador program. We need people that are doing something else outside to jump on it. And also talk about the ASI alliance because it has not been talked about.
