  - [today's meeting issue ](https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/203)

#### Decision Items:
- We decided that for Q4 2024 we will meet monthly, on the first Wednesday of each month. Today is therefore our October meeting; then 6th Nov and 4th Dec. This means that work will be more async this Quarter, and people are encouraged to update their Issues on the project board themselves, outside of meetings, if needed. We will review this decision in our meeting on 4th December and decide whether to revert to fortnightly meetings for Q1 2025.
  - [rationale] Mainly because due to our very focused budget this Quarter, there will not be many tasks for new people in Q4, so there will not be so much need to meet.
  - [opposing] We noted that this might reduce participation in meetings - but we hope to mitigate this by meeting "on the first Wednesday of the month" which might be easier to remember.

- On the redesign of the meeting summary tool - the next key "ease-of-use" feature that André will be implementing is the ability to output all meeting summaries for a particular WG for a period. The plan was to enable output for a whole quarter, but the meeting suggested also making it possible to output all summaries for a month.
  - [rationale] Particularly because people sometimes want all summaries for a month to help with their reporting

- RE tool development for October, we noted that André has recently fixed a bug which caused some accounts not to be able to save a summary. It seemed to be triggered by the "No Summary Given" function, but is now fixed

- On August and September Archives GitBook, we noted that there is still some delay with getting Governance WG summaries up to date, but it is nearly there; some Town Halls are still outstanding and need to be added; and some Marketing Guild summaries are missing.

We noted that the Marketing Guild meeting summary of 16th August, which said "For the sake of working effectively in a ‘singular’ and not divided pattern, decisions being made in the marketing guild should not be made public and outside the guild henceforth", doesn't refer to Marketing Guild summaries at all, as we had thought. According to info from Marketing Guild members who were in this meeting, it actually refers to a specific decision about a collaboration with Rejuve, rather than about Marketing Guild summaries in general, and is rather unclearly-written. So this is not the reason that some Marketing Guild summaries are missing, and we are glad to note that there has not been (as it appeared at first) a decision in Marketing Guild not to document their meetings. Onyeka has access to some of the missing Marketing summaries and will add them.
