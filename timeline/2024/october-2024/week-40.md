  - [today's meeting issue ](https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/203)

#### Decision Items:
- We decided that for Q4 2024 we will meet monthly, on the first Wednesday of each month. Today is therefore our October meeting; then 6th Nov and 4th Dec. This means that work will be more async this Quarter, and people are encouraged to update their Issues on the project board themselves, outside of meetings, if needed. We will review this decision in our meeting on 4th December and decide whether to revert to fortnightly meetings for Q1 2025.
  - [rationale] Mainly because due to our very focused budget this Quarter, there will not be many tasks for new people in Q4, so there will not be so much need to meet.
  - [opposing] We noted that this might reduce participation in meetings - but we hope to mitigate this by meeting "on the first Wednesday of the month" which might be easier to remember.
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- On the redesign of the meeting summary tool - the next key "ease-of-use" feature that André will be implementing is the ability to output all meeting summaries for a particular WG for a period. The plan was to enable output for a whole quarter, but the meeting suggested also making it possible to output all summaries for a month.
  - [rationale] Particularly because people sometimes want all summaries for a month to help with their reporting
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- RE tool development for October, we noted that André has recently fixed a bug which caused some accounts not to be able to save a summary. It seemed to be triggered by the "No Summary Given" function, but is now fixed
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- On August and September Archives GitBook, we noted that there is still some delay with getting Governance WG summaries up to date, but it is nearly there; some Town Halls are still outstanding and need to be added; and some Marketing Guild summaries are missing.

We noted that the Marketing Guild meeting summary of 16th August, which said "For the sake of working effectively in a ‘singular’ and not divided pattern, decisions being made in the marketing guild should not be made public and outside the guild henceforth", doesn't refer to Marketing Guild summaries at all, as we had thought. According to info from Marketing Guild members who were in this meeting, it actually refers to a specific decision about a collaboration with Rejuve, rather than about Marketing Guild summaries in general, and is rather unclearly-written. So this is not the reason that some Marketing Guild summaries are missing, and we are glad to note that there has not been (as it appeared at first) a decision in Marketing Guild not to document their meetings. Onyeka has access to some of the missing Marketing summaries and will add them.

#### Narrative:
1) Reflecting on the recent X space with Ocean Ambassadors (see https://x.com/SNET_Ambassador/status/1841461009573200184) - we said it will be really positive to have ongoing connection with Ocean ambassadors and learn from them. We noted their GitBook https://docs.oceanprotocol.com, and we noted that the X space raised interesting questions on how each Ambassador program approaches the issue of how to attract and retain capable people, especially given that an Ambassador Program usually cannot pay "market rates". Peter also raised the issue  - at the X space itself, and in this meeting - that the sNET Ambassador Program is a bit different from the average, and that he likes the fact that we have a focus on building decentralised community, not just creating content. This meeting generally agreed with this.

2) We looked at the Tasks sheet for Governance WG and set action items on how to progress it (see "Action Items" below)

3) We agreed that at the next Open Gov meeting on 10th Oct, Onboarding WG will share their work on "Onboarding Journeys".

4) We noted that next Tuesday (8th Oct)'s Gov WG session will be a retrospective on the entire "consent decisionmaking" experiment over the last several Quarters, and a small group (Peter, Vani, Guillermo, Love, Onize) will meet on Mon 7th to plan the session. It might lead to further discussion on the agenda item "Should we consider trying a different decision-making process, or continue to explore Consent decision making? How and where will we further discuss possible changes to the process?"

5) We  re-discussed the ongoing agenda issue of "Increasing numbers vs, non-increasing Program budget". We noted that this issue also came up in Onboarding WG earlier today; several WGs are closed or closing, so what are we onboarding people to? We discussed whether there should be some kind of cap on numbers in the program overall - the main thoughts were:
 - If there's a cap on total numbers, how many? (Suggestion:around 60? We currently have 54-ish Core Contributors, and things are beginning to feel "full")
 - If we have a cap, we would need to be clearer about how people come in, and what the "front door" actually is. The "front door" in a sense may be the extant process for becoming a Core Contributor - but where are people coming in to that process from? There was a suggestion that many people are invited by a friend.
 - Should people join the Program by invitation, after they have been attending meetings for a while, and if they talk sense and seem committed? (This obviously raises the question of who "invites" them and who decides. Also, are they "invited" to be a Core Contributor, thereby removing the existing process of automatically becomeing a Core Contributor based on one's activities; or are they simply invited to join the Program at all, and work towards becoming a Core Contributor?)
 - Should we have a set date in the quarter when we accept new people; and otherwise, the official line is "We're closed"?
 - Should any caps on numbers not be across the Program as a whole, but decided WG-by-WG? (i.e. a WG can decide to close, but other WGs might remain open to new people)
- If a WG is closed, this would probably mean that new people can still attend meetings and engage in discussion/share their opinions, but not officially join the WG or take paid tasks.

6) We noted that Core Contributors would need to make the decision about whether to bring in a cap on numbers. We noted that many people are feeling exhausted after the lengthy Q4 budget decision process, so it would probably be best not to start a decision process on a numbers cap immediately, but to allow a couple of weeks for people to "recover". We also noted that the decision would not necessarily need to be made using consent decision-making; another methodology could be selected.

7) We noted that for many decision-making processes (including consent decision-making), there needs to be a proposal to discuss, vote on, consent to, etc. We also noted a potential difficulty: any proposal on this issue would probably have multiple elements, and people might agree with one, and not another; so a proposal would need to be broken down into its different elements and agreement would need to be reached on each part.

8) We noted that the consent decision-making process currently in use was intended as an experiment; that there is discussion in progress on whether to continue with it, or try a different methodology; and that in the Governance WG session on Tuesday 8th Oct there will be a retrospective session on how the consent methodology has gone overall. We mentioned several other possible processes, including consensus, and advisory (a small group researches and makes recommendations).  There was some supporrt for trying both of these, as well as support for the modified "consent process" with an 8-% threshold which has been used for the Q4 budget decision..

8) In the light of the above, we decided  (see "decisions" below) to create a small, temporary focus group to further discuss the issue of a cap on numbers, and to come up with a proposal that could be used in a consent process on the issue if it is decided that consent is the methodology that should be used. This use of a focus group is, in effect, the beginnings of including an "advisory" element in our decisionmaking. The focus group will bring their findings, and a suggested proposal on which Core Contributors could be asked for consent, to the Governance WG meeting on Tues 15th Oct.




#### Decision Items:
- The next Open Gov meeting on 10th Oct will feature a session from Onboarding WG about the research-based work they have done on "Onboarding Journeys", looking at how people onboard to the program and the supports and barriers new people might experience.
  - [rationale] To discuss the research, and see if it helps identify how we can help people overcome barriers.
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- Clement, Ese, Ayo and Ashley will form a temporary focus group to further discuss the issue of a cap on numbers, and to create a proposal about it, on which Core Contributors could be asked for consent or around which another decision methodology (e.g. consensus) could be based. They will bring their findings to the Governance meeting on Tues 15th Oct. They'll receive $40 per person for this work, which will probably (TBC) be taken from the "Initiative incentives" budget line in Governance WG's Q4 budget.
  - [rationale] Ashley was invited as she is new, and it would be useful to have the perspective of someone who isn't yet fully onboarded.
  - [opposing] There were suggestions of paying $50 or $30; the middle ground was selected.
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople

#### Action Items:
- [action] On the Tasks sheet, Vani will 1) chase up who did any missing Q3 tasks; 2) add draft costings for the Q3 tasks that are not costed, and bring it to the next meeting; 3) add Q3 tasks to Dework 4) create a new sheet for Q4 tasks [assignee] CallyFromAuron [due] 10 October 2024 [status] todo
- [action] Colleen will DM Ashley to ensure she knows how to get involved with the focus group and has added her wallet to the Treasury system [assignee] CollyPride [due] 7 October 2024 [status] todo
