- **Purpose:** Weekly Open Governance session

  - [Governance calls, rolling agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t39dwlwLYYB_1z_5szq1rnOH7mVTHe8Tmwv0R6ELOyE/edit?usp=sharing)
  - [Governance Context Setting Document (report back from focus group)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SaZTEaLkYkfxfJeN_9V82olsYDTC3gBIeaT2dQLY9Fk/edit?usp=sharing)
  - [Ideas for new approaches to budget decisions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16jr_Yoq-d_WZWRMNcBFy-GkSNWFbm-VD2J14b69v520/edit?usp=sharing)
  - [CONFLICT RESOLUTION FOR SINGULARITY NET AMBASSADORS](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1beMEt9XmPvHNaH08Rh5_taTI0QhHcyy15Q6XcXXDWUI/edit?usp=sharing)
  - [Decision-making models - a flowchart (Miro board by jeremy Bolander)](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOsELu0U=/)

#### Narrative:
1) Report-back from the Focus Group (Ayo, Clement, Ashley and Ese) on whether or not there should be a cap on Ambassador Program membership. See their context-setting doc here https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SaZTEaLkYkfxfJeN_9V82olsYDTC3gBIeaT2dQLY9Fk/edit?usp=sharing.

Ayo talked through the doc, and answered a couple of questions. We noted:
- when the doc says "fair" distribution of tasks, it does not necessarily mean "equal" distribution (e.g. it might be fair distribution only amongst those qualified/skilled to do a task)
- the idea that WG closures and work-assigning processes should be decided on a WG-by-WG basis, rather than program-wide, is a perspective that has been raised in Governance meetings before, and therefore will be added to the doc.

2) We discussed and agreed (see "Decisions" below) how to progress this issue. The Focus Group's recommendation is that we run a consent process on the options listed in the doc. We discussed:
 - How would this work practically? Suggestions included asking people to select all the options that they might consent to; or using a weighted vote where people distribute e.g. 10 points across the various options.
 - Would this be a binding decision-making consent process, or more of a "temperature-taking" one?
 - Is it open to only Core Contributors, or everyone?
 - How can we generate further discussion while preserving people's anonymity?
 - How can we publicise the process and encourage people to get involved?

3) We discussed and agreed the plan in the Rolling Agenda doc https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t39dwlwLYYB_1z_5szq1rnOH7mVTHe8Tmwv0R6ELOyE/edit?usp=sharing, for what will be covered in future Governance calls over the next few weeks.
We agreed that people will try to come a bit prepared for the first discussion (next Tues, 22nd Oct) by reading the doc "Ideas for new approaches to budget decisions", which came from previous Governance meetings https://docs.google.com/document/d/16jr_Yoq-d_WZWRMNcBFy-GkSNWFbm-VD2J14b69v520/edit?usp=sharing; and/or by looking at Jeremy Bolander's Miro about decision-making methods https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOsELu0U=/

4) The issue of conflict resolution was raised, and it was mentioned that there have recently been some concerns raised about bullying. We referenced:
 - the "conflict resolution" doc that was produced by the old Strategy Guild https://docs.google.com/document/d/1beMEt9XmPvHNaH08Rh5_taTI0QhHcyy15Q6XcXXDWUI/edit?usp=sharing and suggested that we could look at it again;
 - the concept of having a team of "listeners" who can initially do non-directive listening and support anyone who is facing a conflict to decide how to deal with it
 - the idea that we might need some basic training on non-directive listening, and/or communi9cation workshops; and that we could look at trying to fund this in Q1 2025.




#### Decision Items:
- We agreed to create a Cryptpad doc where the solutions suggested by the Focus Group can be further discussed by the whole community; not as a decision-making process yet, but as a "temperature-taking" exercise.
  - [**rationale**] Because we want to collect more input on the issue of a cap on participants in the Program; and we want a way that people can add their thoughts anonymously, but also see what other people are saying.
  - [**opposing**] We considered using a form, but rejected this because people cannot see and engage with other people's answers until afterwards; we also considered using a Miro board but rejected it because Miro is not very mobile-friendly, which might present a barrier to accessing it
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We agreed that the Cryptpad process will be open not only to Core Contributors, but to all
  - [**rationale**] Because if we are asking about a possible cap on membership of the Program, it could introduce bias if we only hear from those who are already members.
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We agreed that we need to publicise the Cryptpad doc and encourage people to engage with it. We agreed to create and post infographics about it; and to add it to the agenda of any meetings we attend (including Town Hall), so it is mentioned and documented.
  - [**rationale**] Because increased publicity seems to be effective. For example, publicising the budget approval process for Q4 resulted in more engagement in the later consent rounds.
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We decided to go with the plan in the Rolling Agenda doc for the topics of the next few Governance sessions; so the next session will be on whether to continue using Consent decisionmaking or not.
  - [**rationale**] Because we need to determine this basic thing before we can agree anything further about our decisionmaking processes.
  - [**opposing**] No opposing voices, though we did say that there should be some flexibility, and it will partly depend on what is agreed in each session.
  - [**effect**] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- We agreed that we want to have some further discussion on how to approach conflict resolution and interpersonal issues such as bullying. We have not yet determined when this will take place.
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople

### Onboarding Workgroup

#### Town Hall Updates:
The October update will cover:
- Recap of Github training session, and share Colleen's slides
- Announce the shift to Biweekly meetings 
- Announce the two upcoming skills training sessions (M&E; decentralized governance)
- Re-share the Onboarding journeys infographics, plus a doc where people can add their own input on barriers they have faced


#### In this meeting we discussed:
- Minutes of the last meeting: We agreed the minutes of the last meeting
- Skillshare matrix: The regular reminder was made for new people to input their skills into the skillshare matrix document.
- Action items from the last meeting: We went through the action items for the last meeting
- Facilitation/documentation next meeting: Colleen to facilitate the next meeting (31st Oct) and Photogee to document and add to the summary tool.
- Town hall update: Duke to give the townhall updates at the end of the month
- Onboarding Journeys: Onize agreed to publicize the infographics created by Duke, Love and Cjfrankie in the ambassador-general Discord channel and other relevant channels. She will also create a survey for people to give info on their own onboarding experiences (see https://forms.gle/VcQVJAoXtYa1ukB77)
-  Skillshare matrix: LadyTempestt noted that the Skillshare Matrix might be somewhat redundant now, as the workgroup is currently closed, so all existing members have already added to it, and any new people would be adding their skills without being able to get paid tasks in which to use them. Vani suggested we could get further use out of the skillshare matrix by sharing it with the rest of the Program, perhaps in collaboration with R&D's collaboration skills database project - we might be able to add useful input on classifying and better representing non-tech skills, as we've done quite a lot of work on that in our skillshare matrix, and the R&D approach has tended to prioritise tech skills. Then LordKizzy spoke on R&D's Collaboration Skills Database project and its possible collaborations with the Onboarding workgroup. He suggested gathering skills of members through the R&D Guild project rather than having two initiatives that serve the same purpose. We agreed to discuss further next meeting.
- Onboarding to decentralization research project: Ayo shared a planning doc created by him and Kateri (see https://docs.google.com/document/d/14erz8t4HKPtql7BB9dK6bKLZ-2KFxay76YWrqgmBfRI/edit?usp=sharing) to outline possible questions, and we discussed. Couple of suggestions were made for minor changes, but generally, the group approved it. Ayo and Kateri will come back next meeting to outline a research strategy or approach.


#### Decision Items:
- It was decided during the meeting that the recording of the GitHub training should not be timestamped or shared
  - [**rationale**] Colleen was absent and Vani had to step in to host the session without adequate preparation, so it might not be that useful; also, LordKizzy has already produced a GitHub walkthru video for Archives WG - see https://youtu.be/abaUWUBOU28?si=PyR0CRq9CLC2e3Na

  - [**opposing**] None
  - [**effect**] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- Onize suggested promoting the onboarding journeys by visiting various workgroup meetings and sharing them, and by creating a form for people to submit their own experiences (see https://forms.gle/VcQVJAoXtYa1ukB77). We decided against sharing information about onboarding challenges on public platforms such as X, since it could be perceived as negative; so we agreed to keep it internal only.
