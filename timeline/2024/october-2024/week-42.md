  - [Decision-making models - a flowchart (Miro board by jeremy Bolander)](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOsELu0U=/)

#### Narrative:
1) Report-back from the Focus Group (Ayo, Clement, Ashley and Ese) on whether or not there should be a cap on Ambassador Program membership. See their context-setting doc here https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SaZTEaLkYkfxfJeN_9V82olsYDTC3gBIeaT2dQLY9Fk/edit?usp=sharing.

Ayo talked through the doc, and answered a couple of questions. We noted:
- when the doc says "fair" distribution of tasks, it does not necessarily mean "equal" distribution (e.g. it might be fair distribution only amongst those qualified/skilled to do a task)
- the idea that WG closures and work-assigning processes should be decided on a WG-by-WG basis, rather than program-wide, is a perspective that has been raised in Governance meetings before, and therefore will be added to the doc.

2) We discussed and agreed (see "Decisions" below) how to progress this issue. The Focus Group's recommendation is that we run a consent process on the options listed in the doc. We discussed:
 - How would this work practically? Suggestions included asking people to select all the options that they might consent to; or using a weighted vote where people distribute e.g. 10 points across the various options.
 - Would this be a binding decision-making consent process, or more of a "temperature-taking" one?
 - Is it open to only Core Contributors, or everyone?
 - How can we generate further discussion while preserving people's anonymity?
 - How can we publicise the process and encourage people to get involved?

3) We discussed and agreed the plan in the Rolling Agenda doc https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t39dwlwLYYB_1z_5szq1rnOH7mVTHe8Tmwv0R6ELOyE/edit?usp=sharing, for what will be covered in future Governance calls over the next few weeks.
We agreed that people will try to come a bit prepared for the first discussion (next Tues, 22nd Oct) by reading the doc "Ideas for new approaches to budget decisions", which came from previous Governance meetings https://docs.google.com/document/d/16jr_Yoq-d_WZWRMNcBFy-GkSNWFbm-VD2J14b69v520/edit?usp=sharing; and/or by looking at Jeremy Bolander's Miro about decision-making methods https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOsELu0U=/

4) The issue of conflict resolution was raised, and it was mentioned that there have recently been some concerns raised about bullying. We referenced:
 - the "conflict resolution" doc that was produced by the old Strategy Guild https://docs.google.com/document/d/1beMEt9XmPvHNaH08Rh5_taTI0QhHcyy15Q6XcXXDWUI/edit?usp=sharing and suggested that we could look at it again;
 - the concept of having a team of "listeners" who can initially do non-directive listening and support anyone who is facing a conflict to decide how to deal with it
 - the idea that we might need some basic training on non-directive listening, and/or communi9cation workshops; and that we could look at trying to fund this in Q1 2025.




#### Decision Items:
- We agreed to create a Cryptpad doc where the solutions suggested by the Focus Group can be further discussed by the whole community; not as a decision-making process yet, but as a "temperature-taking" exercise.
  - [**rationale**] Because we want to collect more input on the issue of a cap on participants in the Program; and we want a way that people can add their thoughts anonymously, but also see what other people are saying.
  - [**opposing**] We considered using a form, but rejected this because people cannot see and engage with other people's answers until afterwards; we also considered using a Miro board but rejected it because Miro is not very mobile-friendly, which might present a barrier to accessing it
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We agreed that the Cryptpad process will be open not only to Core Contributors, but to all
  - [**rationale**] Because if we are asking about a possible cap on membership of the Program, it could introduce bias if we only hear from those who are already members.
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We agreed that we need to publicise the Cryptpad doc and encourage people to engage with it. We agreed to create and post infographics about it; and to add it to the agenda of any meetings we attend (including Town Hall), so it is mentioned and documented.
  - [**rationale**] Because increased publicity seems to be effective. For example, publicising the budget approval process for Q4 resulted in more engagement in the later consent rounds.
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We decided to go with the plan in the Rolling Agenda doc for the topics of the next few Governance sessions; so the next session will be on whether to continue using Consent decisionmaking or not.
  - [**rationale**] Because we need to determine this basic thing before we can agree anything further about our decisionmaking processes.
  - [**opposing**] No opposing voices, though we did say that there should be some flexibility, and it will partly depend on what is agreed in each session.
  - [**effect**] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- We agreed that we want to have some further discussion on how to approach conflict resolution and interpersonal issues such as bullying. We have not yet determined when this will take place.

#### Discussion Points:

- Lord Kizzy shared the screen and gave a breakdown explanation of the content calendar for the entire ambassador program, sharing the goals and guidelines to get submissions from other guilds and workgroups, making sure they align with the guidelines before being posted or scheduled. We are yet to get information/schedules to complete the calendar from other workgroups. 
Kizzy did make mention of the weekly recaps on articles and videos going out at the end of every week and looking at opening a channel, having two representatives from each workgroup to track submissions from the workgroup knowing the current status of the workgroup post. having the workgroup social media marketers from the video, writers, and marketing workgroup present giving their ideas and coming up with this information.
Kizzy also gave an update informing the workgroup on the animation team for the month and how we will go about the subscription process.
