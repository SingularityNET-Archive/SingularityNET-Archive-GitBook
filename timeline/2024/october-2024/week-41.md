In this follow-up meeting, the SNET_LatAm Ambassadors team met with the Strategic Alliances team to finalize the operational strategy for introduction WorkShop for the ASI -fetch.ai- solana-hackathon, which will take effect on Tuesday, October 1st.

Their responsibilities will include moderating discussions, serving as intermediaries for participants in Spanish and Portuguese, clarifying questions, and facilitating the exchange of ideas during the virtual Copa America Hackathon.

The amount to be given to the winners will be established and shared by Rob to the ASAP team in order to incorporate it into the communication and the call to action.
