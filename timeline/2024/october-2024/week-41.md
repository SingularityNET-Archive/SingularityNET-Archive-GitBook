This hackathon aims to challenge participants to leverage Fetch.ai agent tech and Solana’s blockchain to build applications that automate complex workflows and interactions in decentralized systems.

In this follow-up meeting, the SNET_LatAm Ambassadors team met with the Strategic Alliances team to finalize the operational strategy for introduction WorkShop for the ASI -fetch.ai- solana-hackathon, which will take effect on Tuesday, October 1st. 

The LatAm team will provide support through communication channels and human resources to assist the Fetch technical team. Their responsibilities will include moderating discussions, serving as intermediaries for participants in Spanish and Portuguese, clarifying questions, and facilitating the exchange of ideas during the virtual Copa America Hackathon.

It was agreed during the meeting that the LatAm team would help with the introduction in Portuguese in charge of Andre and Daniela, supporting Rob and Sergey, who will handle the introductions in English and Spanish. Following the introduction, the team will participate in the first workshop of the event.

Additionally, the LatAm team will document each intervention and action, establish a methodology for tracking action items, and create a form to collect participant inquiries, which will help streamline a funnel of questions and answers.

The amount to be given to the winners will be established and shared by Rob to the ASAP team in order to incorporate it into the communication and the call to action.
