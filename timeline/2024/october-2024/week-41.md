  - [AI Ethics GitHub project board](https://github.com/orgs/SingularityNet-Ambassador-Program/projects/1/views/2)

#### Narrative:
We began by going over the projects board on GitHub, beginning with the tasks "in-progress".

-  Most people still have their Q3 interview tasks in "to-do" - they were reminded to move them to "in progress" once they start interviewing. We noted that Q3 interviews will be costed under Q3 budget although we are aware that some will not be finished until way into Q4. There’s a soft deadline in place of 14th November; but we’ll set final *final* deadlines with people individually and async. 
- Payment for the work people did at AGI-24: The Foundation has said that people may invoice individually in fiat if they are able to; so we are now waiting for information on exactly what an invoice needs to include and how it should be formatted. However, since not everyone is legally able to invoice, we are still pursuing a solution which will enable payments to be processed via the Ambassador Program's treasury system, although there are obvious difficulties given that the Ambassador Program has no official legal status, so it is difficult for the Foundation to process payment.
- Documenting GEI sessions: Jenn has not finished these yet, and hasn't responded to messages. We *could* reassign the task if there are Read.ai recordings available; but perhaps not a priority - we discussed whether we could let it go.

Tasks "to do":
- Co-chair mentee: Duke and Clement have expressed interest in the role in the past; they have agreed between them that Clement will take it for Q4 2024.
- Q4 interviewing: Issues have now been created on the board for Q4 interviews, but most people have not begun yet. Questions and updates can be raised in the Interviewers group chat on Discord.
- Survey-sharing: 6 people indicated interest in survey sharing: PG, Kenichi, Valola, Clement, Onize and Ashley. 
- Survey-sharing payment: The budget for this work is $30 each for 6 people, but how much sharing of the AI Ethics survey should one do for $30? We agreed that payment will be based on evidence that the survey has been shared, rather than on recording how many actual responses are garnered, since it's out of people's control how many replies they get, and because confidentiality and data-protection issues will arise if we try to keep evidence of who the respondents are. So as long as WG members can show they have done the work of sharing the survey and giving the information, that is enough. We also agreed that, for Q4 at least, surveys should be shared online even for personal contacts (so for instance, if you are sharing it to friends and family, you should email it to them rather than just telling them about it, to make it more possible to evidence that you did it).  Several suggestions were made for approaches to sharing - for example, in relevant threads on Reddit; via Twitter; and Kenichi mentioned sharing it at a conference he will be attending  this November in Lagos.
 

#### Decision Items:
- We agreed that if, by the WG meeting on 4th November, a lot of people have not yet completed their interviews, we will see if there is a need to set up a meeting to figure out the blockers and find a solution to moving forward. 

  - [**rationale**] People might be feeling anxious over preparations or might need further support
  - [**effect**] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- As soon as Vani gets info on how an invoice to the Foundation needs to look, she will open individual issues on the board to get the AGI-24 conference tasks ready for pay.

  - [**rationale**] The task is overdue for pay
  - [**effect**] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- LadyTempestt, as async work manager, will talk to interviewers individually to set 'final final' deadlines for Q3 interviews
  - [**rationale**] Interviewers' individual circumstances might vary, so we need to set individual deadlines
  - [**effect**] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- Duke is handing over the co-chair mentee task to Clement
  - [**effect**] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- Anyone interested in Q4 interviews who has not yet added their name and the details of who they want to interview to the list in the WG Google sheet, should do so as soon as possible.
  - [**effect**] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- Colleen will document the next meeting on 4th November, and LadyTempestt will take the 2nd of December.
  - [**effect**] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup

#### Narrative:
Discussion Points:
Duke initiated the meeting by sharing his thoughts on decentralization and its contrast with his country's oligarchy system. 

Recap of the BeGIN initiative’s aims and the role of the AI Ethics WG in supporting this.
Esther began by giving a recap of the BeGIN (Beneficial General Intelligence Nexus for EthicalAI), she mentioned the initiative started cause there’s hardly any voicing out of views on the ethics surrounding AI.  
She discussed the aim of gathering human values on safety and ethics and providing ways for people to contribute resources towards safe and ethical AI.
It has two phases: the creation of an AI chatbot and knowledge graphing; and a DAO resource-sharing system, which means people can contribute resources to the ecosystem and carefully distribute or set up systems to distribute the resources fairly. 

At present, we are in phase 0 of manual data collection. This is a crucial role of the AI Ethics Working Group (WG) within BeGIN. The collected data will serve as the foundation for constructing an information structure for the knowledge graph and subsequently developing the chatbot. 

Esther also spoke of the idea of "magic wand" -style questions: "What kind of AI tools would you want to develop if you had unlimited money?" This can create data for how people want to see AI and its resources used. She also spoke of the need to prioritise highly diverse data: so not just SNET ambassadors or people who know about AI, but also elderly people, young people, and even those who know zero about AI.

This phase 0 is so important and the interviews are such great reference points of data and will guide the chatbot to work for the users. She also noted that if any interviewee would like to be further involved in the process after their interview, they can state this on the consent form and there will be pathways for them to get further involved.

Phase 1 will be building the AI chatbot that exudes human values and ethics when interacted with.

And Phase 2 is the resource sharing system: resources such as time/volunteering, data, currency, crypto, computing resources. She spoke about how complex this phase will be because a system needs to be implemented of how time will be shared and how currency will be shared fairly. 

She also explained roughly how the DAO resource sharing will work: how this will be specifically about how AI resources will be shared, how the resources are governed and how they are fairly distributed. An evidence-based resource sharing will give structure to the DAO. The data coming in from the population about ethics can help us structure the operational side of the DAO.

She discussed the definition of a knowledge graph and what it entails. The knowledge graph will organize the interview data, and use the transcripts to code them into categories such as geographical locations and concepts linking them, which will help track patterns in the data. 

She went on to explain what KG are for: They are used first to represent knowledge and they are designed to grow and change based on the data collected from the interviews. They also help provide a way for LLMs and machines to interpret knowledge. She emphasized its usefulness in policymaking, science, and decision-making.

Onize asked about how testing for bias in the data would work and how the data would be handled. Esther addressed this by speaking of how that has been in consideration in the project and a team of data analysts will be set up to work on it.

Vani raised the need to collect demographic data to support analysis, and Esther highlighted its importance in the interviews. They discussed what data to prioritise and how to keep it concise, but no clear decision was made. It was agreed that further discussion is needed to finalise the approach and how to phrase things: for example, should we ask people about their "identity", or might that not always be understood? Colleen suggested asking  "Do you identify with any particular group of people?" and it was agreed this might be an effective way to put it in interviews.

We confirmed that when interviewers submit their audio files, they should use the agreed file naming convention: the file should be named with the interview's reference number and the date. This is so that interview audio files remain clearly associated with the relevant consent form, and also means that if an interviewee gets in touch to say they wish to withdraw, we can easily find their interview to delete it.

Leeloo announced the BGI Bookclub which would bring people together and inspire knowledge sharing. Mweetings will be biweekly beginning from October 16, and it will be open for the ecosystem to be a part of.

The meeting praised Duke and African Guild for their recent successful "AI Ethics Expo" event. African Guild hopes to organize similar future events, based on positive attendee feedback. They plan to maintain the current event scale rather than expand to larger formats. It was agreed to discuss funding and potential Foundation involvement in more detail at the next BeGIN Open Office.


#### Action Items:
- [**action**] Finding a way to collect demographic data and data on sensitive cases such as class, gender, and groups will help build the ethical framework for the KG and impact interviewers. However, it was not decided who would follow up on this, and a clear assignee and timeline would be confirmed in future discussions. [**due**] 8 October 2024 [**status**] todo

#### Agenda item 1 - Update objectives Q4  - [carry over]

#### Narrative:
On September 12th, the SingularityNET Strategic Alliances team requested support from the SNET_LatAm team for the ASI X Solana Copa America AI Track initiative. 'Building Cross-Chain AI Agents with Fetch.ai and Solana'

This hackathon aims to challenge participants to leverage Fetch.ai agent tech and Solana’s blockchain to build applications that automate complex workflows and interactions in decentralized systems. We have outlined three levels of problem complexity—easy, medium, and complex—each presenting its own challenge.


In this follow-up meeting, the SNET_LatAm Ambassadors team met with the Strategic Alliances team to finalize the operational strategy for introduction WorkShop for the ASI -fetch.ai- solana-hackathon, which will take effect on Tuesday, October 1st. 

The LatAm team will provide support through communication channels and human resources to assist the Fetch technical team. Their responsibilities will include moderating discussions, serving as intermediaries for participants in Spanish and Portuguese, clarifying questions, and facilitating the exchange of ideas during the virtual Copa America Hackathon.

It was agreed during the meeting that the LatAm team would help with the introduction in Portuguese in charge of Andre and Daniela, supporting Rob and Sergey, who will handle the introductions in English and Spanish. Following the introduction, the team will participate in the first workshop of the event.

Additionally, the LatAm team will document each intervention and action, establish a methodology for tracking action items, and create a form to collect participant inquiries, which will help streamline a funnel of questions and answers.

The amount to be given to the winners will be established and shared by Rob to the ASAP team in order to incorporate it into the communication and the call to action.

At 18:00 UTC RoOb shared a text with the opening remarks for the Workshop. <<Link on top>>

The tentative schedule for Tuesday, October 1st, is as follows:

10:00 AM BRT (UTC-3:00): Opening remarks with Sana Wajid and Alex Blagirev
10:30 AM BRT (UTC-3:00): "Built on Fetch.ai" session with Abhi

#### Narrative:
Kickoff: The meeting commenced with a warm greeting from Duke to all members. 

Documentation strategy: An issue was raised regarding the use of different documenting templates. This prompted a conversation on the need for consistency in the documentation process. Duke suggested appointing someone to take on the role of Archivist. This person would be responsible for reviewing all our documentation since the project began, scrutinizing it, and helping to define a clear and consistent structure.

Update on Research for Developing Indigenous AI Tooling: Onize gave an update that they have started making progress: they have drawn up their line of action and are awaiting a template from Ayo on the research. Duke highlighted the need for feedback on progress due to the time-sensitive nature of the project and the approaching deadline. He also requested a budget for the research so it can be properly allocated and fitted in the budget planning.

Update on Ubuntu and AI conversation: Duke clarified that the feedback we have been getting is excellent and we have clearance to continue. If we are thinking about the next city aside from Abuja, it would be Lagos. It was brought to our notice that the recorded versions of the events are accessible and they are in the drive. 
For our next iteration, Duke said that he had a theme he had come up with 'Ubuntu and AI memories of the future' although it is not set and may still change. 

Use of cameras during the meeting: There was a suggestion for people to have their cameras on during meetings. However, this was met with strong opposition from the majority of members.

- **Purpose:** Weekly meeting of the writer's workgroup, centered on the Q4 proposed budget.
- **Working Docs:**
  - [🧵 Twitter Threads Suggestions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/151H-_93hmL5Y59q_aQOxhkZ4-NpDM1Y6C7AfyHzNSQQ/edit)

#### Narrative:
Dework task updates: highlighting the people with a pending task. 

Cjfrankie shared his Twitter thread suggestions document. Kevin Frey piqued interest in the recently released X space “Longevity, Biotech, & Web3: How DeSci is Shaping the World.” He commended Rejuve for their work, and mentioned that he had close communication with Rejuve to see how biotech could help women Olympians in 2028.

Q4 Budget: Mikasa, Lady Tempestt, Gorga and Cjfrankie set the Thames on fire as we tackled discussions around the Q4 budget. We discussed splitting the budget to stablecoin, and keeping the remaining half in the foundation token (AGIX). We’re still skeptical about doing so if it’s not within the Treasury management. Cjfrankie is tasked to chase André or Effiom to get more insights into the swapping of AGIX to stablecoin, and if it eventually becomes a reality, will the treasury hold it? 

Following that, we discussed how to reward the outstanding tasks from September 2024. We also decided that those tasks won’t go unrewarded. So, the treasury should offset all Q3 pending payments with the Q4 allocation. There was a conversation about creating a multi-signature wallet to properly oversee our budget and know what’s coming in and going out. On the flip side, we agreed that Treasury would have access to this wallet's seed phrase, and it would have 5 signatories. Mikasa also highlighted some of the key reasons why AGIX's price dropped lately. 

More on the Budget: Kenichi also shared a brighter outlook on the budget by discussing how a bot can help simplify the multi-sig. Using the treasury bot, for example, he hinted that the bot can ping the wallet signers, give updates on transactions right inside the WWG channel, and more!!


#### Decision Items:
- We agreed to tell the Treasury to offset Q3 pending tasks with the Q4 budget.
  - [**rationale**] We couldn't just sit back and watch workgroup members go unpaid after all the effort they put in.
  - [**effect**] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup

#### Action Items:
- [**action**] Cjfrankie to chase André concerning the pending Q3 tasks that haven’t been paid out! Letting him know that the treasury can offset the cost from the proposed Q4 budget.

 [**assignee**] Cjfrankie  [**due**] 11 October 2024 [**status**] done
