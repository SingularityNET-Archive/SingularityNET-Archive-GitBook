- New rules for proposal planning

#### Discussion Points:
- Updates status on Development to fill Repo: Rojo gave updates on the development status on the Social Media Automation and Web Contributions Dashboard; he said: "For the Web3 dashboard and social media dashboard, we're almost done with the MVP. Obviously, you can see the code from the repos on our common GitHub. I think once the MVP is ready, we can open-source the code. We're going through some testings for the UI. We have very minimal backend functionalities for now, just because there wasn't enough time to have a lot of the functionalities that we predicted. But still, there is something to be tested and something to be improved. I expect it to be open source in the next week and a half, depending on how fast I will get well. But it should be done very soon. After that, we will be doing some testing with other workgroup members. And I guess the reporting on that would be part of Q3, not Q2. So Q2 was mainly about getting an MVP out."   Ubio gave updates on his reasearch: "What we did was simply to convert responses we got from Q1 into Figma. In Q2, We converted the responses and the things we could derive from those response into a prototype design.  so that's what we did for Q2. Q3 for us is about now taking that design back to the community to engage and see what comes out of that."
-  Presentation by Kenichi on a reputation system using SoulBound Tokens, here is the link to the document; https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l0A8BFSe_RDvqDLHyJaIa1A92ggXwBBNUG2RtM8BIgo/edit Rojo highlighted the similarities between this project and other web3 contributions projects and offered for a collaboration
- There were discussions on R&D Guild Q2 Quarterly Report / R&D Guild Proposal & Q2 Community Concerns Response Document. there was an inclusion of more detailed deliverables
- Discussion on Q3 Budget proposal, we had a brief Overview of the R&D Guild Budget for Q3 
- Discussions on New rules for PROPOSAL planning; There was a document highlighting the new rules for budget planning to prevent similar issues encounter in the previous Quarters (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iaU5LI1KmKmcCbIa5yI1iRmDiqnkpzWNmnrgeRhvgeo/edit?usp=sharing)

#### Decision Items:
- We decided that if, by the closing date of Q2, the teams involved in the development proposal doesn't present progress in the assigned repositories and their respective reports with details of the progress and status, the resources assigned to said proposals will not be disbursed and will be reevaluated.
  - [rationale] This is to help build transparency between the Guild and the Community by providing deliverables

Introduction: Statutory greeting calls in the multiple languages spoken across Africa by Ese Williams.
Follow-up on previous Action Items
Work ongoing on the Onboarding process structure document; Sucre, Love.
Skills Database: Several people yet to fill in the skill database
sNET African Guild Research on expansion and penetration strategies into other African Countries under way; critical success expected before next meeting: Clement.
Initiative and Contribution Framework Document suggested to be opened to the guild or at least to a team of contributors because of necessary scope.

Getting more African countries into the Program and Guild: Suggestion towards strategy as a project by a select team to get more African countries onboard; feels like Nigeria is already at capacity in the Guild: Duke. Onyeka suggests a cross-country community approach while being mindful of the program’s budget. 

Creative quarterly bounties: To be discussed further for ideation in the next meeting.
Cross collaboration with AI Ethics WG: A SNET African Guild AI Ethics Expo, a collaborative event effort being accomplished alongside the AI Ethics workgroup.
Town Hall Updates: Takers asked for who will do the townhall updates
Onboarding Structure Update: Sucre urged people to make further contributions to the onboarding structure document.
AMA Session Update: Ese reports that the AMA preparations are in the marketing phase and everything on queue.
Q2 Report and Q3 Budget: Link shared so everyone can see, read and drop comments where they deem necessary. Duke sheds light on the circumstances of the report completion. Also budget approval is not automatic. All fingers advised to be crossed.
AOB: Sucre wanted to understand why the Telegram group isn’t as active as before. Duke responded that it is difficult to discuss operational subjects on Telegram as there are people in the Telegram group who have yet to onboard to the Ambassador Program itself, which is a prerequisite to being a member. A concern was raised about why we are still using Google Meet and not Zoom. Resolved with an action item.
Closing: All hands to be on deck for the furtherance of the objectives of the guild. Appreciation to everyone about how the AG call was free from tension that could have come from the Governance call.


#### Decision Items:
- We agreed the next meeting should happen on Zoom.

#### Narrative:
The meeting started with Kenichi welcoming everyone to the meeting, and then he highlighted the agenda items.

The meeting kicked off as Kenichi surfed dework to check assigned tasks and tasks in progress, and then he asked the scribblers to share an update regarding their tasks - Devon, Mikasa, and Cjfrankie updated us with their respective tasks.

In the meeting, we reviewed the “new Scribbler onboarding form.” Kenichi highlighted the importance of the form. He also stated that the form will help track new people coming to the WG and if they decide to become scribblers in the future. 

Kenichi proposed the idea of tracking meeting matrices since read.ai doesn't track data such as attendance or the time people joined a meeting. Then he also emphasized  the importance of these data and how they will help in the WG in the future.

Following that, he also proposed the idea of points delegations, where the scribblers and the scribes will be awarded an extra 10 points from the points system. These points can be delegated to other members of the workgroup to show love and support for their contributions towards your task(s), or whatever the case might be! 

We also addressed and answered questions regarding the aspirants who took the WG test.

Lady Tempestt proposed the idea of implementing a rotational meeting facilitation system in the WWG, and then Kenichi cleared the air by saying that the scribes could facilitate meetings in his absence.

Discussion on dropping off inactive members with the scribbler tag; this discussion set the Thames on fire. As we fleshed out the tests of the aspiring writers, we desire to give room for new scribblers to join us, explore the world of AI, and also tell captivating stories through writing.



#### Decision Items:
- We decided to move the point delegation mechanism to the next quarter.
  - [rationale] Because Q3 is almost over!
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- We decided that inactive members with the scribbler tag would be dropped off, and then they would be given the pupil tag; the scribbler tag can be reinstated until they reach the scribbler threshold again.
  - [rationale] We want to create a opportunity window for aspirants to tell thir story through writing.
