#### Narrative:
AI Ethics Strategy drafting: 
we discussed whether it would be a better idea to have a mix of experts and non-experts to collaborate on drafting the 3 strategies we want to complete. We noted that we have no proof of people's self-rated skill/knowledge level - but we agreed that it's fine, in this instance, to trust people on what they say about themselves. We discussed having 2 teams for each strategy - one for "writing" (3 people) and one for "review/edit" (2 people), and we suggested people should only sign up for one thing, to ensure that the work is shared out fairly between people. Ayo suggested min/max "points" level for each task - 24 for writing team and 12 for edit team -  (based on people's 1 to 10 "how skilled are you" self-rating), to ensure we get a reasonable level of expertise. Given the number of people interested, we have under-budgeted for this initiative; but we agreed we could move a bit of budget from another budget-line which we are unlikely to fully use, e.g. "Communication management & community outreach". 

Co-chair
We discussed if having a co-chair (a channel of communication between the AI Ethics WG and the Foundation's Global Ethics Initiative) is a good idea. The AI Ethics WG idea did come from them. Some of us feel we should try it and if it's not a great idea then we can shut it down. We will see what people think about it at the repeat meeting for other timezones on Wednesday. We created a signup space for those who have already done Q2 work on this, in page 2 of https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vLC4ZIHO3WN-Ah9XwehRmbwLZAeePsxxYQXmLiiJLnQ/edit?usp=sharing

Workgroup membership:
We agreed that we DO want some kind of membership and a Discord tag, but we agreed that we will raise this at Wednesday's meeting and see if people have ideas on how to decide who is a member. We mentioned that meeting attendance isn't necessarily the same as participation, you can be quite passive in a meeting. We were unsure how to measure contribution: MINS tokens were suggested but not everyone agreed.

Q3 WG Budget: 
We need to submit a budget by 19th June. We will create an extra sheet on the planning spreadsheet where everyone can put in ideas for what we should do in Q3, and the budget that would be needed. The link will be shared on Discord.

Forum for Ethics discussion: 
Is it a great idea? People agreed that we should do it and that it should be open to all - but it needs to be specifically for discussion on ethics issues, not for workgroup organizational stuff. Moderators would be able to help enforce this - but we are not sure who CAN be a moderator, as it would give you moderator rights for the entire SNET discord server. LeeLoo, Duke, Gorga, and Clement are interested in being a moderator.

Future meeting:
Should we meet again on the 24th and 26th of June for this quarter? We will see what people say about it on Wednesday and in Discord channel discussion.

#### Narrative:
AI Ethics Strategy drafting: 
Leeloo introduced herself and got the meeting started with discussion on the Strategy-drafting tasks, making reference to key takeaways from the AI Ethics WG 10th June Meeting (see meeting notes).

Tevo asked if there was a time/hour requirement for the Strategy-drafting tasks: none has been set yet. 

The “Shadow-Mentoring” approach of the workgroup: it is the intent that less-experienced members of this workgroup are able to shadow more skilled people. LeeLoo referenced that there was already some considerable consent for this in the Monday meeting. Several thumbs-up to this regard with no dissenting leanings.

Leeloo emphasized that there was room for anyone who wanted, to suggest additions or changes to the AI Ethics Workgroup stuff! spreadsheet in this meeting.

Before the strategy-drafting teams start wirk, there will be an orientation meeting for them with the GEI team from the Foundation: date TBC

There were also no different opinions to the selection points system suggested on Mon 10th by Ayo for those to work on the Strategy-drafting tasks.

Gorga asked if the spreadsheet is definitive as to what roles anyone will play in the strategy drafting tasks. Leeloo explained that  it isn't.

Co-chair role:
Guillermo suggested there should be a contributions-based criteria for the selection. Leeloo responded that it was okay if Guillermo wanted to put his name in the AI Ethics Workgroup stuff!  because all the names got there on the basis of self-election. Leeloo outlined possible requirements and expectations of the co-chair. Duke and Clement added their names to the sheet, made their intentions known to be considered for the co-chair. There was some confusion here, since the signup sheet is actually to record who has done "co-cahir"-type work in quarter *two* of 2024 (April to June), but people are signing up to express interest for Quarter **three*.

Workgroup Membership
the meeting built on 10th June discussion. 
Ayo suggested that meeting attendance could form a strong base for membership criteria. 

LeeLoo added that there may be instances where people contribute extensively asynchronously without attending the formal meetings. Ayo agreed with the addendum that it therefore falls on everyone to come up with hybrid all-encompassing membership criteria, and how they will be measured and applied. 

Clement suggested a tiered membership.

Kenichi opined that core-membership should be based on technical contributions and to see if there could be more tiers than one. Core membership could be also goal orientated, which could solve both short term and long term concerns. Tags could also help. 

Ayo suggested moving forward by adopting a simple two tier (first tier by intention, attendance and participation; second tier by proven, measured and accepted sync and or a-sync contributions). 

Guillermo pointed out that tasks or expected contributions are already stated in AI Ethics Workgroup stuff!  Leeloo redirected that the excel sheet did only cover for the specifics of strategy drafting. 

Q3 Budget
The draft budget (sheet 3 of AI Ethics Workgroup stuff!) seemed to agree with everyone present in the meeting. Ayo suggested that it may be nice if the budget catered for something Leeloo later described as the "information and resource archive guide" - budget for a person or system that guarantees that everyone can be informed of all the ethics workgroup uncovers or documents as milestones or research are made.

Private forum for Ethics discussion:
Everyone agreed that we should be a forum for ethics discussion. After contributions from Clement, Kenichi, Leeloo and Ayo, the general consensus was that the forum will be open so everyone can follow the conversations therein, but only the 2-tier ethics workgroup member will be able to speak/chat in the forum. 

Guillermo suggested that the discussion and consensus be subjected to further conversations in subsequent meetings.

Next meeting
Should we meet again on the 24th and 26th of June for this quarter? 24th was favoured.

#### Narrative:
The meeting started with Kenichi welcoming everyone to the meeting, he highlighted the meeting's agenda and then we went over the action items from the last meeting.

Ines, tasked with managing the Twitter Spanish page, shared an update from the Twitter side of things! This led to a discussion on what logo would best fit the Spanish page. Following that, she also mentioned the need for a tweet sample from Mikasa that she could use as a template for writing content for the Spanish page.

Discussion and digging deep into the Q3 budget and projections. Kenichi opened the floor for suggestions and ideas will be welcomed with open arms.

Today's meeting also navigated the axis of our substack newsletter and how articles will be published in the future.

We talked about our monthly newsletter; even though we aim to reach more people via email, we want individuals to choose whether they want to receive our emails so we don't clutter their inboxes.

We discussed how the community page articles will be paid for - it was suggested that drafts will be rewarded based on word count and performance. Any article that performs well over time will be rewarded from the points system allocation.

Lady Tempestt asks Kenichi about the Cogito articles from last year and the reward status, and then Kenichi says he'll reach out to Sandra.

On the other hand, Ayo spoke about the WWG onboarding process - he suggested that the WG could have an automated, seamless and faster onboarding process rather than leveraging human power. 

We addressed how many people can get onboarded in a quarter! Since Ines raised questions like (will there be work for new people who are joining the WWG newly?). Ines suggests that we do onboarding at the end of each quarter to help us prepare future budgets and allocation to reward all contributions without having a second thought.

- We decided that 4 articles would be published on our community page every month - Thursdays to be precise.
  - [rationale] To keep people engaged and to reach a wider audience.
