#### Narrative:
Attendee Count: 19 unique individuals, 20 devices.

Meeting Narrative:

Membership Criteria: Vani referenced the previous meeting - people do want membership, and a 2 tier system has been suggested but not yet agreed, and [7:33] mentioned her impression that hierarchical membership structures appeal to some, but not all. LadyTempestt [9:20] agreed with keeping it simple, and starting by giving tag to people who have attend meetings. Aetherblade suggested in Chat that there's a difference between people who look and people who contribute. Vani suggested [9:47] instead of meeting attendance, use contribution/posting in Discord, since it's hard to find a meeting time that everyone can do, but Discord posting can be in own time. After mention of several options, consent (no objections) to giving tag to anyone who comments in the WG Discord, and reassess later if we find we need tiers. Soundwaves confirmed that adding the tag to those active in Discord can be automated using the ME6 bot that we already have [9:20].

Strategy-drafting: [11:47] the 3 writers and 2 editors for each strategy have all confirmed (see AI Ethics Workgroup stuff! spreadsheet). There will be an orientation meeting with Esther and Haley for each team, to define scope and discuss content; then teams will self-organise. Completion dates: third week in July (Fri 19th) for writing and 2nd August 2024 for editing.

Q2 Budget and Spend [22:08]: see "AI Ethics WG Quarter 2 payments and budget rec" spreadsheet. Vani explained how this doc takes the Q2 budget written by Peter, Esther and herself, and fits it to the work that's actually been done, including the strategy drafting work (with more money than originally planned); and Vani's own work in setting up the WG. No objections. BUT it was noted that Colleen did some co-ordinating work in Q2 that needs to be added.

A Co-chair[26:33] Consensus is reached, the WG is to have a Co-chair who will work with the Global AI Ethics Initiative (GEI) team (Haley, Esther) and with LeeLoo as the other Co-Chair, but from the Foundation side.

Selecting Co-ordination Roles for Q3 [29:58]: A Cryptpad document will be created so anyone/everyone can drop anonymous comments in favour (or otherwise) of the “contestants” for various posts including the Co-chair role, to help us decide. 
Those interested: 
Co-chair: Colleen, Clement, Duke, Vani.
WG Reportbacks: Jenn
Async work support: Love, Gorga, Malik, Slate.
WG internal management: Kenichi, Sucre, Ayo.

Q2 quarterly report, and Budget for Q3 [41:28]: Have been submitted, Members of the WG who are Core Contributors are reminded to submit consent forms for the WG budget and for other G and WG budgets.

Forum for AI ethics discussions [42:12]: Peter will create the forum. Clement signified interest in moderator role, which will be rewarded from the contingency budget.

When to meet [54:47]: Meeting time will move to 14:00 UTC, and next meeting is 8th July 2024.

Meeting ends: 59:17.

Note: this meeting summary significantly amended and tidied by Vani - issues such as lack of clarity in narrative section and some things incorrectly documented; not including things as decisions/action items; not using decision rationales


#### Decision Items:
- There will be a co-chair role
  - [rationale] useful to have liaison with GEI
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- Meeting time will stay on Mondays, fortnightly, but will move to one hour earlier (14:00 UTC) 
  - [rationale] to suit timing needs of the people who are mainly attending
  - [opposing] none
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- We will have an open but tightly moderated forum for AI ethics discussion; and it will be placed outside of the Ambassador Program section of Discord
  - [rationale] Moderation, to ensure all threads are specifically about AI ethics; placement of the Forum is so that it's seen by all, not just Ambassador program.
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- Discord tag will be given to anyone who comments in the WG Discord; will try to automate it.
  - [rationale] because it's a form of contribution, and might be better than basing it on meeting attendance , since it's hard to find a meeting time that everyone can do, but Discord posting can be in own time.
  - [opposing] Some have said there might need to be a hierarchy of Discord membership tags, as there is a difference between those who look, and those who really participate. We agreed to rethink and add a hierarchy later if it feels needed.
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- Strategy-drafting teams to consciously work async e.g. via shared docs
  - [rationale] because people are in different time zones, and we have quite tight deadlines.
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- We agreed to the budget allocations for Q2 outlined in the "AI Ethics WG Quarter 2 payments and budget rec" spreadsheet
  - [rationale] it rewards the work we are actually doing in Q2, and makes reasonable sense with the original budget
  - [opposing] none
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- Moderation of the Forum will be rewarded from our contingency budget for Q3
  - [rationale] since we forgot to include a specific budget line for it in the Q3 budget
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup

- Type of meeting: Biweekly
- Present: Stephen [facilitator], Stephen, CallyFromAuron [documenter], Stephen, André, Ekemini Samuel, Ayo, Peter, Gorga Siagian, Clement Umoh, daniel effiom, Kenichi, SucrenSpice, lord kizzy, CallyFromAuron, CollyPride, sakujennbornean, kateri
- Meeting video: [Link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4dGsCqdRj6ct6TwdrVKm_Bjg2ToCjzQh)
- Working Docs:
  - [Q2 budget](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d9j-IPA0wary0EdR8YIoKl1BF0mAtkV_dgTs0hSnzAs/edit?usp=sharing)
  - [Draft AI ethics doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MIItGDkPIBMA6x-_rvIaWvpRE_sKkkz9TdEhao_MVwM/edit?usp=sharing)
  - [LLM development - Data loading and preprocessing](https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/LLM-Development/blob/main/Colab/Data_Loading_and_Preprocessing.ipynb)
  - [LLM development - Vector store creation and similarity search](https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/LLM-Development/blob/main/Colab/Vector_Store_Creation.ipynb)
  - [SNET Archive AI features (draft of possible features an AI tool might have)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LROsgVAQ9fQbNgMRK5qMI8q8KYsN-rGI-Gq9lvXAN5w/edit?usp=sharing)
  - [draft Q3 budget](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14IYxBj-9MGCZRkYIupwvbHgPYZgohnyMSQ-EUFBgpYI/edit?usp=sharing)
  - [meeting issue](https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/171)

#### Decision Items:
- Interesting discussion on how to record people's names in the Archives, which came out of the Tag Taxonomy work. We recognise that many people go by more than one name - but for clarity we decided that in future, "Discord name = Archives name". André will look at the feasibility of creating a controlled vocab dropdown based on info from Discord bits.
  - [rationale] If people are in the Archives under only 1 name, an LLM will be better able to make sense of any qwuery about them. It's also better for privacy - some people might use a Discord pseudonym for privacy reasons 
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- Our Q3 budget was approved, but there will be some budget-fitting needed. We agreed to make changes from the "one-off" tasks only as far as possible, and preserve the "regular tasks" budget; we also agreed that as far as possible we will move things to Q4 rather than not doing them at all. We discussed some possible cuts, but may need to raise this in our next meeting and discuss further, if the lowering percentage for budget fitting is increased.
  - [rationale] We want to avoid cuts to core activities
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- We looked at Ubio's recent work on testing around 30 LLM models with the Archives corpus material - but as his spreadsheet is in Excel format, we decided to ask him to convert it to a more widely readable format such as a Google Sheet
  - [rationale] not everyone has access to Excel
- André's docs management and tooling work: André has now created an interface to enable us to manually make an archival copy of a doc that has been submitted via the summary tool, and also to manually add docs that have not been added via the tool.  The interface captures doc content in markdown, and holds it in the Archives database. Vani and André need to go through it in near future
  - [rationale] This enables us to capture, archivem, and open-source the documents that are submitted to the Archives, which may be held by different people in the program and may be vulnerable to accidental deletion
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- The Q2 RAG process - Stephen is documenting it directly in an "LLM Development" section on the Archives GitBook  https://snet-ambassadors.gitbook.io/singularitynet-archive/development/llm-development - we agreed that longterm, this section might also accommodate some of Andre's and Ubio's work. In Q3, Stephen will also add "plain English" explanations of e.g. vector store creation, checking and safeguarding; and further Python code samples, that need to be reproducible.
  - [rationale] "Plain English" explanations will be important for community engagement, to make the work accessible to others who might not have technical knowledge
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- Work on our OpenSource paradigm - we discussed when to make the planned presentation, and whether it should be in a Town Hall, or a separate session with a trailer in TH? See https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/164
  - [rationale] The wish to engage more people with the issues around Open Source
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- André's tool development work for June 2024 - basic maintenance, but no significant new features. But André has begun to collate issues that need to be addressed in the Q3 redesign of the Tool, and we agreed he will create a doc for this
  - [rationale] so as not to lose any of the insights that come up via everyday use of the Tool
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- On the work on the "pre-Archives WG" Backlog - we agreed to also add the Deepfunding Community Governance meetings, in addition to Town Halls
  - [rationale] Because the community governance meetings are significant enough to be worth archiving; and, since it turns out there are not many Town Halls to add, the budget for this work could cover adding them.
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- We agreed on a deadline of 3rd July for the backlog work
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- RE the planned Town Hall reporting back on the Tag Taxonomy work, we agreed that it will be presented at next TH on 2nd July
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We noted that Governance WG will pay Ese to upload their backlog of summaries to the Tool
  - [rationale] Gov WG has budget to cover this, and they have summaries written and ready to upload, but don't really have time to do it.
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople

#### Action Items:
- [action] Duke to create a video walkthru of how to use the GitHub Board - see https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/116   Still no word from Duke on it. If nothing by next meeting, we will reassign this [assignee] duke peter [due] 10 July 2024 [status] in progress

- [action] Sucre, Clement and Lord_Kizzy thave selected 2 "best meeting summary" winners from late May/early June; results will be publicly shared on 2nd July after Town Hall. But due to low quality of summaries, there might not be a winner for next week - in which case, they will make a post to say what was missing from the summaries we have that meant they could not win. See this issue https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/152  After this, there will still be 2 more winners to be selected under Q2 budget before we move to the Q3 budget. [assignee] SucrenSpice, lord kizzy, Clement Umoh [due] 26 June 2024 [status] done
- [action] Ekemini and Ese to liaise outside the meeting on Town Hall presentation on Ubio's work, and decide when to present. They can message André with any questions.

#### In this meeting we discussed:
- Minutes from the last meeting and action items; we agreed to the minutes of last meeting.
- Onboarding Journeys update: Onize suggested that we make it in a way that the person who is engaging the content sees the ecosystem as a place they get to meet to help with the problem they are experiencing. 
- Skills Matrix: Vani wanted to know if everyone had added their thoughts on the document and said that the document is open till the end of the week for people that still want to put their thoughts down.
- Q3 budget:Our Q3 budget got consent, but since the total requested across all WGs is higher than the total available, budget-fitting will need to be implemented. The Lower percentage is yet to be determined, but we will get less than we asked for.
- Suggestions towards a better onboarding process.
- Facilitation / Documentation Roster: There were some discussions around WHO the next facilitator and documenter was going to be and  Lord kizzy indicated that he was working on a roster and he would present it in the channel before the next meeting.   
- Gorga said that he had been passed over in the assignment of tasks such as documenting due to xenophobia, prejudice and favouritism, and that the workgroup's practices were untransparent. People in the meeting addressed these issues in the Zoom chat - see doc attached.

#### Decision Items:
- We agreed to have Sucre work on editing the budget and present it at next week's meeting.
  - [rationale] Because we are still waiting to know the lowering percentage for budget fitting, and we will definitely need to make cuts
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- We decided to keep the Onboarding WG Skillshare Matrix document open until the next meeting for members to add their input.

  - [AI's Impact on Jobs and Workforce](https://medium.com/singularitynet-ambassador-community-page/ais-impact-on-jobs-and-workforce-ec1ecb41b530)

#### Narrative:
The meeting started with Cjfrankie welcoming everyone to the meeting, and then Advance Ameyaw introduced himself, highlighting his skills and interest in the writer's workgroup. Following that, Cjfrankie asked Lady Tempestt, and Devon to share updates on their task, which they did!

Kenichi hops on the call and takes the wheel. As Q2 2024 concludes, the WWG reflects on our achievements in Q2. With screen sharing, Kenichi shares the community page progress — so far, four authors have published their articles, namely Ines, Devon, Cjfrankie, and Lady Tempestt.

Progressively, Kenichi shared an update from the Zealy and Notion sides of things, highlighting our journey and the progress the workgroup has achieved in the last few months. We also talked about our substack and how to implement a comment session for people to voice their opinions as they read the monthly recap. Kenichi also pointed out that we have a French speaker in the person of Emmanuel Isaac — going forward, he will be managing the WG French page on X.

Momentarily, Onize, who recently took the WWG, asked, “Can aspirants who didn't pass the WWG test still take on tasks?” This question was followed up with Kenichi’s reply, saying that the WG might implement the “taskforce mechanism.” The idea is to enable people without the Scribbler tag who possess certain skills like graphics, to be able to pick up tasks and earn rewards for their contributions.

We reached our Q2 KPIs through collaborative efforts - see y'all next quarter!

We had discussions centered around the points system and how to increase transparency  — Lady Tempestt, who emphasized making the system more transparent because many people in the community seem to have little knowledge about how it works. Kenichi shares the metrics, and what’s being measured, and how contributors earn the allocation. In view of the points system allocation and how to be more transparent, Lady Tempestt suggests that the WG could write a detailed document that highlights how the points are assigned and why people get a certain share.

The meeting ended with Kenichi announcing the trivia session that would be held today, noting that everyone should get ready for a thrilling session. Everyone expressed their thoughts, and we talked about the current people leading the trivia and how they could make room for other people to win; we all laughed, and we called it a day! See y'all next quarter.



#### Decision Items:
- Having gone through the SNET ambassador’s substack, it's clear that we have published only one article — given the fact that the SNET ambassador program recaps go out once a quarter. We have decided that the monthly recap will go out every month moving forward.
  - [rationale] Publishing the recaps on a monthly basis will bootstrap the substack engagement and it will open door for more acquisition.
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- We are looking to add a comment section on the substack to allow readers to voice their thoughts after they digest the monthly recaps.
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup

#### Learning Points:
- With screen sharing, Kenichi showcases how the points system works. We learned about the metrics he tracks (meeting attendance, note-taking, article suggestions — to name a few!)

#### Keywords/tags:
- topics covered: Notion, Q2 report, Taskforce, medium, monthly substack, Zealy sprint, community page, points system, budget reserve
