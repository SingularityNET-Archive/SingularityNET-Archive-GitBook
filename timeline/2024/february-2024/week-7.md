#### Discussion Points:
- Discussion started with the Education Guild Budget Request for Q1 2024 
- After having a look on the  treasury guild last meeting, concerns were raised for the amount being put for the facilitation and management
- On note to that, Headelf decided to cut off the facilitation/management and planning along with the dework task management completely.
- 30 USD for scribing is a fair amount or not ?
- On this question Rojo said that it is a standard amount now for scribing meeting notes (which led to agreement of this amount)

- The infographic quality was good and most of the details were mentioned

- Video needs a bit rework before auditing (Headelf)
- Should we post these videos to the public?(Rojo) They are pretty good

#### Narrative:
Presentation of MAP (3D Model Graphic) for the project
Gaming Session - Game made By Slate - Maze Game 
Workshop By @Slate  On basics of "How to Use Roblox Studio". Slate was not able to record the workshop because of screen lag, so proceeded to give the workshop without recording so that everyone can see it clearly. He will record it later for Youtube.

A lot of questions were asked by @Tenbasetee about doing certain things on Roblox Studio, which Slate effciently answered by showcasing how each thing works and is made inside of Roblox Studio.

Then the Gaming Session happened, and everyone was intrigued to ask who made this game and enjoyed it while playing.



#### Decision Items:
- After Flyn And Devon presented the MAP graphic (3D model), it got some feedback that the Ambassador Townhall should be put in the centre rather than on the corner 
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- We agreed to make the pathway in the 3D model more of a casual pathway rather than a road, as it's inside of a university and not an urban model

  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- We agreed that whoever gets familiar with the usage of Roblox Studio and takes this workshop can work on the project collaboratively with the guild .
