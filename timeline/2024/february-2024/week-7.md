#### In this meeting we discussed:
- Education Guild - Budget Request 
- Ambassador Certification Program Infographic by Ese Williams about Awakening - Health
- Ambassador Certification Program Video by Osmium about Mindplex 

#### Discussion Points:
- Discussion started with the Education Guild Budget Request for Q1 2024 
- After having a look on the  treasury guild last meeting, concerns were raised for the amount being put for the facilitation and management
- On note to that, Headelf decided to cut off the facilitation/management and planning along with the dework task management completely.
- 30 USD for scribing is a fair amount or not ?
- On this question Rojo said that it is a standard amount now for scribing meeting notes (which led to agreement of this amount)
- Then EseWilliams infographic on Awakening Health was discussed 
- The infographic quality was good and most of the details were mentioned 
- Headelf pointed out some minor grammar mistakes and Peter said that Hong Kong, China should be changed to just Hong Kong 
- Rojo said that the graphic is good and just needs some minor rework and can be audited by next week 
- Then Osmium Video on Mindplex was discussed.
- The Reviews on the video are as follows : 1) Graphic couldn't be read  2)Voice sounded a little AI 3) AI voice is okeay-sh (Rojo), Visual is good (Rojo), Transition was good (Rojo), Good video (Rojo). 4) AL instead of ai (Peter), San Francisco HeadQuarters needs research
- Video needs a bit rework before auditing (Headelf)
- Should we post these videos to the public?(Rojo) They are pretty good 

#### Decision Items:
- 30 USD for scribing in these meeting is a fair amount 
  - [rationale] because it's standard across many workgroups
