#### Decision Items:
- Governance GitBook should aim to cover and document experiments in governance across sNET . Should probably include documentation of research as well, such as Strategy Guild's research into decision making methods.
  - [rationale] There is a difference between internal and external. Also background research leads to governance experimentation so it's good to include it

- Congratulations to Slate for meeting publicity, which seems to have brought a couple of new people to the meeting. Note there was an issue because Slate didn't have rights to post embedded links in Discord - now fixed for Archives Workgroup channel, but might need correcting for a couple more channels
  - [rationale] Some new people are in today's meeting because they are doing bounties, but a couple are here because they saw the publicity, which is great.
