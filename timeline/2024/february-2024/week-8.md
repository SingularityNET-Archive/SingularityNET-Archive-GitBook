  - [Meeting Issue](https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/104)

#### Decision Items:
- Governance GitBook should aim to cover and document experiments in governance across sNET . Should probably include documentation of research as well, such as Strategy Guild's research into decision making methods.
  - [rationale] There is a difference between internal and external. Also background research leads to governance experimentation so it's good to include it

- We congratulated Andre on really useful updates to the Meeting Summary tool: to make it clearer what has and has not been archived; addition of new templates for Town Halls and one-off meetings; and ability for workgroups to manage action items more smoothly from within the tool itself

- Congratulations to Slate for meeting publicity, which seems to have brought a couple of new people to the meeting. Note there was an issue because Slate didn't have rights to post embedded links in Discord - now fixed for Archives Workgroup channel, but might need correcting for a couple more channels
  - [rationale] Some new people are in today's meeting because they are doing bounties, but a couple are here because they saw the publicity, which is great.

- Congratulations to Ese for her work on chasing missing meeting summaries, to SucrenSpice for updates to Ambassador GitBook  - all is going smoothly

- Now that Google Analytics have been set up, Onyeka can start properly doing archives publicity
  - [rationale] Analytics means we can see if more people are viewing the Archives and get some idea if the publicity is working
