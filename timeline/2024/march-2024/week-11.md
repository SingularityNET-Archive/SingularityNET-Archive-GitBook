#### Discussion Points:
- Slate welcomed everyone in the meeting 
- graphic made by Gorga, Rebel, Scare_crow on the project which will be used as a thumbnail was represented 
- Rebel presented his graphic and everybody really liked the graphic which was made like a roblox character welcoming everybody 
- Then Scare_crow presented his graphic which covered like a civilization point of view working which was a representation of the Ambassador Program. 
- There was also a suggestion on Scarecrow graphic that it should be showing more buildings as department.
- Then Gorga Graphic was presented which covered a more general view of the cardano ecosystem rather than the Ambassador Program 
- So Slate on this said that we should be priortizing the Ambassador Program first rather than the spinoffs or the Cardano ecosystem because this project is focused on it.
- Slate asked Gorga to rework his graphic according to the proposal .
- Slate then mentioned that him and hufi went to the Onboarding workgroup to collect information to be implemented in their workgroup and said that they had a suggestion to animate the NPC's of the contributors to be doing different stuff like researching NPC , documenting NPC , Welcoming / waving NPC etc 
- There was also a suggestion to include every contributor to the respective Department 
- Then Slate introduced the prompting system in which we had two options
- After showcasing both, Slate asked which one should be implemented then in the vote 2nd one got selected.
- Then the gaming session happened in which today's game was "Capture The Flag"
