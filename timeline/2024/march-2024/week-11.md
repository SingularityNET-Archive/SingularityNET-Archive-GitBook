- During the reviewing of Ese's video, Slate pointed out that the subtitles are big in some places and very small in some places

- Then we reviewed Rojo's video on Zarqa 
- Headelf had the suggestion that the interviews which are put inside of the video should have the name of the person who is speaking as a highlight 
- Ese suggested to shorten the clips and add more visuals 
- Slate said that he would have preferred to add more subtitles to the video due to different accents of the speakers, and lessen the interviews and in place of them add visuals explaining that aspect of the project.
- Budget suggestions were taken from the attendees.
- Slate said that we should start working on hosting Twitter spaces, like having general AMAs and other stuff 
- He said that we should put more focus on social media publicity like lives and YouTube podcasts etc 
- Another suggestion was made to translate the Education videos which are made to different languages, as this will help to broaden the effect of the ACP and will also help to more understand what the project is all about.

- Rebel presented his graphic and everybody really liked the graphic which was made like a roblox character welcoming everybody 
- Then Scare_crow presented his graphic which covered like a civilization point of view working which was a representation of the Ambassador Program. 
- There was also a suggestion on Scarecrow graphic that it should be showing more buildings as department.
- Then Gorga Graphic was presented which covered a more general view of the cardano ecosystem rather than the Ambassador Program 
- So Slate on this said that we should be priortizing the Ambassador Program first rather than the spinoffs or the Cardano ecosystem because this project is focused on it.
- Slate asked Gorga to rework his graphic according to the proposal .
- Slate then mentioned that him and hufi went to the Onboarding workgroup to collect information to be implemented in their workgroup and said that they had a suggestion to animate the NPC's of the contributors to be doing different stuff like researching NPC , documenting NPC , Welcoming / waving NPC etc
