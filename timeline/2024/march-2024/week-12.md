- We will continue the bounty to chase outstanding meeting summaries (done by Ese) in Quarter 2
  - [rationale] It has been very useful in clarifying which summaries are missing, and has produced good responses when people are chased - February is almost entirely complete

- We will continue the bounty to update the Ambassador GitBook (done by Sucre) in Q2
  - [rationale] It has been useful to keep things up to date; although getting workgroups' quarterly reports hasn't been easy, and not everyone writes one.
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- Based on what Sucre has encountered when trying to collect quarterly reports from WGs, the meeting felt that quarterly reports should be if not mandatory, then at least more commonly done; and that the issue should be raised in Treasury Guild.
  - [rationale] Quarterly reports are a form of accountability for a WG's funding

- The meeting agreed that the Town Hall session yesterday (19th March 2024) on tips and tricks for meeting summaries was useful; and there was a suggestion of doing a similar session on the way we use GitHub
  - [rationale] Short, sessions in a public space such as Town Hall are useful
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We agreed that everyone can make suggestions for small tasks and/or bounties to include in the Q2 budget - suggestions to be added to the relevant Issue on the board
  - [rationale] Particularly looking for bounties that will encourage people to use the Archives.
