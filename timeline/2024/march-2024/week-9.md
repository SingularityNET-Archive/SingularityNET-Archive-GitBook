#### Narrative:
We discussed numbers and the highlights of Feb 2024.

Creating threads on the BGI event.

Kenichi mentioned we should make our articles more interesting to read; he gave examples of how to use image generators and how to create the proper prompts. 

Kenichi also spoke about the test reviews the Scribblers made. Lady Tempestt received kudos for her review, while most Scribblers mixed up or got the instructions wrong. He suggested other Scribblers take a look at Lady Tempestt's.

Kenichi talked about having articles and threads for our social media appearance.

We assessed our medium page statistics for the month and had impressive numbers. We reached over 800 views and more than 600 reads for February alone.

Kenichi informed Scribblers to take tasks with priority bars more seriously, and tasks with any level of priority bars would be accepted if thereâ€™s a brief before the draft.

Kenichi will be adding more tasks to Dework.



#### Decision Items:
- Scribblers who made the wrong reviews are to make another review.
