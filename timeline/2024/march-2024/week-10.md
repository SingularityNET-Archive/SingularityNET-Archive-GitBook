#### In this meeting we discussed:
- Minutes of the last meeting
- Action Items from the last meeting
- Sign-off of 2 Continuous Onboarding docs, and Onboarding slides voiceover (with music version)
- New Welcome video - link has disappeared
- Town Hall update
- Idea of a new Introduction channel on Discord ("tell-us-your-interest" or "which-workgroup-should-I-join?")
- Outstanding work that was budgeted for in Q1 and not yet done: Onboarding Journeys
- Q2 budget - what should be included?
- Should Onboarding WG be promoted as the first stop for new people?

#### Decision Items:
- Duke's voiceover video of the Onboarding slides should be added to Ambassador google drive and Youtube
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We will post the Continuous Onboarding docs in Discord after they have been shared in a Town Hall
  - [rationale] we want to officially launch them via Town Hall
- We will all think about the idea of a "which WG should I join" Discord channel  in the context of our Q2 budget, and discuss next week. Agreed that current Introductions channel isn't working well
  - [rationale] There will be costs associated with doing it: someone will need to make sure they keep aware what WGs are doing, to point people to the right one; so best to look at it in context of budget
  - [opposing] Some felt it might duplicate what is already being done. Some felt that moving Introductions channel so it's under Ambassador section of Discord would help
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- We will discuss next week the idea of Onboarding being promoted as a first WG that people should join, in the context of Q2 budget.  The idea is to promote "learning by doing", and aim to mentor and support new people to get involved in the actual tasks of the workgroup
  - [rationale] Whichever approach we take would have budget implications - if we aim to integrate new people into our work, we would need to budget for mentorship, buddying, etc; or, if meetings are made longer and include a weekly onboarding session, we need to budget for that.
  - [opposing] Some felt that we should instead make Onboarding meetings longer, and have an onboarding support session for new people at the end of each meeting;
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We will create some Onboarding Journeys by the end of the quarter - aim for 3
  - [rationale] it's something we budgeted for this quarter, and that still feels important to do
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- Gamers Guild will be joining our next meeting, to discuss how they will present Onboarding WG in their Roblox game about the Ambassador program
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
