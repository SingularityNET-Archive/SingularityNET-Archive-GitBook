- Working Docs:
  - [Meeting Issue](https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/104)

#### Decision Items:
- On meeting publicity: we agreed that if this task continues in Q2, it should probably shift towards DMing those involved in the WG (perhaps even reminding them of their action items?) rather than general publicity
  - [rationale] New people are coming more because they are doing bounties and getting involved with the work of the group, than becaue they are responding to publicity. But Slate DMd people this week, and people said they liked it and found it useful
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- We agreed on doing a Town Hall presentation to share tips and tricks on making good meeting summaries. Provisional date 19th March, subject to checking with Peter. Vanessa to create slides, Ese to deliver, and Onyeka to facilitate Q&A.
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We will offer bounties for people to use the Archives to create short (90-second) reports at TH on what WGs have done this quarter, as a supplement to the WGs' own reports. Subject to agreement from WG leads, provisional date TH on 26th March
  - [rationale] It's a good way to get people using the Archives and becoming aware of other WGs' work.
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We agreed that the "correction and maintenance of monthly reocrds" work will cover June to end of August this quarter; Sept-Dec will be done in Q2
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- Ubio has made a short video to demonstrate his work on AI application of (human-generated) tags to the corpus - all agreed it was great
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- Kenichi gave a backlog of Writers' Workgroup summaries from 2023 and 2024 - we agreed that Vanessa will add them to the achives (manually for the 2023 ones, and via the tool for the later ones); and  Kenichi will raise it at a writers' WG meeting and find someone to do it for the future
  - [rationale] Because once you have backlog that has mounted up, it can feel exhausting to clear it - so easier if Vanessa does it
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We agreed Duke, Onyeka and Ese will timestamp the BGI video material (subject to verifying how many videos there are). We'll use the going rate of $15 per video. Also agreed that since Ese has not done it before, Duke will meet her to explain how it's done; and agreed that Onyeka will upload the timestamps to the YouTube account since he has access to it.
  - [rationale] It's important archival material, and we don't think any other WG has planned to do it.
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople

  - [New welcome video script](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Iy4jotEpsJbYe2lWNArQrSU9kAPKfvj9oHfbweokTuA/edit)

#### Town Hall Updates:
Share our Continuous Onboarding report and Ideas and Improvements report. 
Give a report-back on the onboarding session on 8th Feb.
Share Duke’s voiceover video for the Onboarding slides.
Advertise that the next onboarding session is on 16th May.



#### In this meeting we discussed:
- Minutes of the last meeting
- Action Items from the last meeting
- Sign-off of 2 Continuous Onboarding docs, and Onboarding slides voiceover (with music version)
- New Welcome video - link has disappeared
- Town Hall update
- Idea of a new Introduction channel on Discord ("tell-us-your-interest" or "which-workgroup-should-I-join?")
- Outstanding work that was budgeted for in Q1 and not yet done: Onboarding Journeys
- Q2 budget - what should be included?
- Should Onboarding WG be promoted as the first stop for new people?

#### Decision Items:
- Duke's voiceover video of the Onboarding slides should be added to Ambassador google drive and Youtube
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We will post the Continuous Onboarding docs in Discord after they have been shared in a Town Hall
  - [rationale] we want to officially launch them via Town Hall
- We will all think about the idea of a "which WG should I join" Discord channel  in the context of our Q2 budget, and discuss next week. Agreed that current Introductions channel isn't working well
  - [rationale] There will be costs associated with doing it: someone will need to make sure they keep aware what WGs are doing, to point people to the right one; so best to look at it in context of budget
  - [opposing] Some felt it might duplicate what is already being done. Some felt that moving Introductions channel so it's under Ambassador section of Discord would help
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- We will discuss next week the idea of Onboarding being promoted as a first WG that people should join, in the context of Q2 budget.  The idea is to promote "learning by doing", and aim to mentor and support new people to get involved in the actual tasks of the workgroup
  - [rationale] Whichever approach we take would have budget implications - if we aim to integrate new people into our work, we would need to budget for mentorship, buddying, etc; or, if meetings are made longer and include a weekly onboarding session, we need to budget for that.
  - [opposing] Some felt that we should instead make Onboarding meetings longer, and have an onboarding support session for new people at the end of each meeting;
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We will create some Onboarding Journeys by the end of the quarter - aim for 3
  - [rationale] it's something we budgeted for this quarter, and that still feels important to do
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- Gamers Guild will be joining our next meeting, to discuss how they will present Onboarding WG in their Roblox game about the Ambassador program
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople

- Purpose: Announcing the successful launch of our Zealy.
#### Narrative:
The first 25 minutes of the meeting were dedicated to sharing vital insights into how our zealy would run after now.
To keep community members engaged, an NFT badge might be implemented to reward participation.
A brand guideline is also very crucial; it would be a 40-page PDF containing things such as colors, typography, logo, and more!
According to the WG lead - Kenichi, the Points System for February has been paid, however, he wasn’t impressed with our performances - we’re urged to improve our communication, and attendance, and suggest more articles.
