  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We decided on $25 for the first time and $20 after that for preparations and presentation of the workgroup updates in the Townhall meetings
  - [rationale] Someone suggested that since the person will have to keep note of everything happening within the month and prepare a report for the workgroup update and still present them in the Townhall so $25/$20 is a fair price
  - [opposing] Someone suggest that is should be the same amount with meeting facilitation but a bit lower $20 if it's your first time and $15 afterwards
