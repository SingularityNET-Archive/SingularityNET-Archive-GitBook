  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We decided to publicize our research reports on the Ideas & Potential improvement and also Continuous Onboarding Report.
  - [rationale] We decided to create infographics for the publicity, because it tends to pull people's attention towards the document
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We decided to publicize our session with André on "Everything you need to know on Treasury and payment" by creating a graphic
  - [rationale] We need to get everyone who still has questions and issues regarding payments to attend the session
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We decided on $25 for the first time and $20 after that for preparations and presentation of the workgroup updates in the Townhall meetings
  - [rationale] Someone suggested that since the person will have to keep note of everything happening within the month and prepare a report for the workgroup update and still present them in the Townhall so $25/$20 is a fair price
  - [opposing] Someone suggest that is should be the same amount with meeting facilitation but a bit lower $20 if it's your first time and $15 afterwards
