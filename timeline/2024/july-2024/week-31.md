#### Agenda Items:
- Welcoming new Members and Introduction
- Review of last meeting summary Action Items
- UPDATE STATUS ON DEVELOPMENT TO FILL REPOS! 
- SHOWCASE FINISHED PROPOSAL
- NEW OPERATIONS SYSTEM GOING FORWARD

#### Discussion Points:
- Review of last meeting summary Action Items: Lordkizzy went through the action items for the previous meeting
- UPDATE STATUS ON DEVELOPMENT: Rojo gave the updates on Social Media Automation; The platform is currently in testing. The way the platform will interact with social media is that there is an API contact and some of these APIs need some time to be approved. We got approval from Google, YouTube API, and we're waiting for X (Twitter) and for Facebook. We're doing some testing. We are polishing the UI. We will do a push for the GitHub. Probably today or tomorrow we should be doing a push. Rojo shared a major challenge: he came across  an open source project called Mixpost. This open source project is basically like an open source replica of Buffer.com, which does social media automation and social media dashboarding and team coordination, which is what the Guild is aiming for. He is currently testing this solution and the major issue is if while testing this solution, it does prove itself to be as good as what he seen so far, would it be a good idea to actually use this solution and part of the funding for our project so far would go to hosting and maintaining this solution rather than keeping working on the previous one and trying to improve it to reach the same level because our aim from the beginning was to build an open source project for this exact case. And it is sad that we had to build so far all of these things and just to realize that there was a solution already available, but it might be a more judicious and a smarter thing to do is to actually build upon previous open source solution that are already existing. 
- UPDATE STATUS ON DEVELOPMENT: Rojo gave the updates on the Web3 dashboard:  He is done with the UI design. Talks will commence with Treasury Guild  so that we can have the data access. Once we have the data access, we will be building from that.
- UPDATE STATUS ON DEVELOPMENT: Kenichi gave the updates on the Legacy website
- SHOWCASE FINISHED PROPOSAL: The Town Hall presentation for the Research on Inclusivity of people with disabilities was conducted by Clement on 30th of July 2024, now it's just left with the public announcement
- NEW OPERATIONS SYSTEM GOING FORWARD: Lordkizzy shared the new operations system going forward

#### Decision Items:
