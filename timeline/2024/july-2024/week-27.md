#### Narrative:
The meeting began with technical issues being addressed and the meeting agenda being shared and made accessible to all team members. The team discussed the use of routine tools and resources such as Discord SNET server, Zoom, and Google Docs. Ayo suggested discussing the budget first due to time constraints and the relevance of the topic. The team discussed the quarterly budget, focusing on the Agix token prices and its impact on the budget.

They calculated the approximate value in dollars and compared it to the previous quarter's budget. The discussion revolved around the allocation of the budget across different workgroups and guilds. There was a focus on ensuring fair distribution and maximizing the value of the available budget, with concerns raised about excessive allocation to certain areas and the potential impact on the community.

The team discussed reducing hourly rates and increasing work hours to maintain the total budget at $30. There was a debate on the appropriate hourly rate and the amount of work required for different tasks, leading to a decision to continue the discussion asynchronously on Discord. Gavriel proposed compensating core contributors with $4,000 for 15 hours of strategy development and discussion, with each core member expected to contribute 5 hours.

Billy suggested reducing the hours to 5 or 6 per week for three core members, and emphasized the need to learn and adjust as they go. Gavriel and others discussed the complexity of developing a knowledge management and dissemination strategy, emphasizing the need for strategic alignment across the community. There was a debate about the role of delegation and the overlap with the Knowledge Base workgroup.

Billy and Gavriel addressed concerns about the budget. Ayo clarified the distinction between weekly meetings and workshops, and encouraged everyone to access the strategy budget proposal document for further discussion and input.


#### Decision Items:

#### Narrative:
Safety and Ethics across sNET
- Esther is sitting in on interviews with people in the ecosystem re safety and ethics issues
- Matthew Newman (was on 1st Supervisory Council) is working on creating a structure for developing safety and ethics internally in sNET as a whole
- LeeLoo is working on similar with the spinoffs

How to gauge interest from Ambassador Program in attending AGI24?
- Visa concerns will be stronger as it's in the US and it's soon.
- Can offer a letter of invitation from Program chair, which might help people secure a visa.
- Virtual engagement is possible too - GEI is planning a virtual Round Table on 7th August and a 6-month followup.
- Hoping to have some of the roundtable discussions at AGI24 virtually too - would be great to have Ambassador program involved

Naming competition
- Want to announce the GEI's existence at AGI24 - hence, naming competition will launch soon.
- If winner is inappropriate, how will we choose?
- Planning to use Jokerace - but should there be a proxy vote system for those who don't wish to connect a wallet?
- How is voting weight determined on Jokerace? Group members will test it. If it is plutocratic (i.e. 1 token 1 vote) we will not use.
- How to publicise it on socials?
- A 1-pager has been written to outline what the GEI is and ensure people understand what they are naming. Guillermo will transdlate to Spanish and Portuguese.


Asia/Pacific Internet governance networks
- Jenn is working with these - they have an initiative to learn about AI ethics. Can it be integrated with the GEI?
- LeeLoo: education is a huge part of the GEI, but in the longer term. Current focus is on gathering the public's opinion. We can connect in a few months, when we move more towards education.

Scope of GEI survey
Clement: is it within sNET< or wider?
Haley: It's for all voices, including those not in WEb3 groups.
LeeLoo: I have a good grasp of marginalised communities that don't use much tech, and how to engage them.

Licensing of materials collected from surveys and interviews
 - Agree Creative Commons all the way!
 - CC BY-NC sharealike preferred
 - Do we licence material to individual interviewees? Always best to licence to a person, not an organisation, since organisations change; but this could be fiddly to manage and a problem if people do not want to be named.
- To be discussed further
 




#### Decision Items:
- Naming competition will be launched in next week or two, with a 1-week window for people to sugggest names. Probably using Jokerace. $50 prize.
  - [rationale] need to get new name in place ideally before AGI24
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We'll link up with Jenn's Asia-Pacific Internet Governance networks at some point in future months
  - [rationale] because at the moment the focus for GEI is on collecting opinion, not education
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We'll return to the discussion on licencing and Creative Commons in a future meeting
  - [rationale] need to determine WHO we should licence material from interviews to?
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople

#### Action Items:
- [action] Find out feasibility of Ambassador Program attending the 2 forthcoming AI events: still considering; will depend on budget. GEI has secured some funding from the Foundation for this (they have matched the AI Ethics WG's Q2 budget, c. $3,800) [assignee] Haley, Esther [due] 16 July 2024 [status] in progress
