#### Narrative:
The meeting began with technical issues being addressed and the meeting agenda being shared and made accessible to all team members. The team discussed the use of routine tools and resources such as Discord SNET server, Zoom, and Google Docs. Ayo suggested discussing the budget first due to time constraints and the relevance of the topic. The team discussed the quarterly budget, focusing on the Agix token prices and its impact on the budget.

They calculated the approximate value in dollars and compared it to the previous quarter's budget. The discussion revolved around the allocation of the budget across different workgroups and guilds. There was a focus on ensuring fair distribution and maximizing the value of the available budget, with concerns raised about excessive allocation to certain areas and the potential impact on the community.

The team discussed reducing hourly rates and increasing work hours to maintain the total budget at $30. There was a debate on the appropriate hourly rate and the amount of work required for different tasks, leading to a decision to continue the discussion asynchronously on Discord. Gavriel proposed compensating core contributors with $4,000 for 15 hours of strategy development and discussion, with each core member expected to contribute 5 hours.

Billy suggested reducing the hours to 5 or 6 per week for three core members, and emphasized the need to learn and adjust as they go. Gavriel and others discussed the complexity of developing a knowledge management and dissemination strategy, emphasizing the need for strategic alignment across the community. There was a debate about the role of delegation and the overlap with the Knowledge Base workgroup.

Billy and Gavriel addressed concerns about the budget. Ayo clarified the distinction between weekly meetings and workshops, and encouraged everyone to access the strategy budget proposal document for further discussion and input.

  - [Interview participant information sheet and informed consent form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E8xIl3Yge3uCN1Nk1J68XaoNE9-_Ou5PpHejVmFRwP4/edit?usp=sharing)

#### Narrative:
Safety and Ethics across sNET
- Esther is sitting in on interviews with people in the ecosystem re safety and ethics issues
- Matthew Newman (was on 1st Supervisory Council) is working on creating a structure for developing safety and ethics internally in sNET as a whole
- LeeLoo is working on similar with the spinoffs

How to gauge interest from Ambassador Program in attending AGI24?
- Visa concerns will be stronger as it's in the US and it's soon.
- Can offer a letter of invitation from Program chair, which might help people secure a visa.
- Virtual engagement is possible too - GEI is planning a virtual Round Table on 7th August and a 6-month followup.
- Hoping to have some of the roundtable discussions at AGI24 virtually too - would be great to have Ambassador program involved

Naming competition
- Want to announce the GEI's existence at AGI24 - hence, naming competition will launch soon.
- If winner is inappropriate, how will we choose?
- Planning to use Jokerace - but should there be a proxy vote system for those who don't wish to connect a wallet?
- How is voting weight determined on Jokerace? Group members will test it. If it is plutocratic (i.e. 1 token 1 vote) we will not use.
- How to publicise it on socials?
- A 1-pager has been written to outline what the GEI is and ensure people understand what they are naming. Guillermo will transdlate to Spanish and Portuguese.


Asia/Pacific Internet governance networks
- Jenn is working with these - they have an initiative to learn about AI ethics. Can it be integrated with the GEI?
- LeeLoo: education is a huge part of the GEI, but in the longer term. Current focus is on gathering the public's opinion. We can connect in a few months, when we move more towards education.

Scope of GEI survey
Clement: is it within sNET< or wider?
Haley: It's for all voices, including those not in WEb3 groups.
LeeLoo: I have a good grasp of marginalised communities that don't use much tech, and how to engage them.

Licensing of materials collected from surveys and interviews
 - Agree Creative Commons all the way!
 - CC BY-NC sharealike preferred
 - Do we licence material to individual interviewees? Always best to licence to a person, not an organisation, since organisations change; but this could be fiddly to manage and a problem if people do not want to be named.
- To be discussed further
 




#### Decision Items:
- Naming competition will be launched in next week or two, with a 1-week window for people to sugggest names. Probably using Jokerace. $50 prize.
  - [rationale] need to get new name in place ideally before AGI24
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We'll link up with Jenn's Asia-Pacific Internet Governance networks at some point in future months
  - [rationale] because at the moment the focus for GEI is on collecting opinion, not education
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We'll return to the discussion on licencing and Creative Commons in a future meeting
  - [rationale] need to determine WHO we should licence material from interviews to?
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople

#### Action Items:
- [action] Find out feasibility of Ambassador Program attending the 2 forthcoming AI events: still considering; will depend on budget. GEI has secured some funding from the Foundation for this (they have matched the AI Ethics WG's Q2 budget, c. $3,800) [assignee] Haley, Esther [due] 16 July 2024 [status] in progress

Guillermo also reflected on the previous decision, that "50% of tokens will be distributed once a project achieves 80% completion". 
- Discussions on the overlapping concern presented by the community: "I do not understand the value of this project, should be further brought up in the General Ambassador Program, because I read it as the system we have already in place. Or if it's only related to the R and D guild then include that scope that is something you build for your own workgroup." Guillermo highlighted the similarities between Rojo's project on Web3 contribution dashboard and Kenichi's project on Loyalty system. Kenichi highlighted the difference between the Treasury dashboard and the loyalty system. Guillermo also requested that Kenichi writes a 1 page document addressing concerns about the overlapping proposals and collaboration with existing projects.

#### In this meeting we discussed:
- Agreeing to the minutes of the last meeting. We also agreed to add some neutral information regarding why the meeting was "argumentative"; the summary also lacks relevant tags. Kateri noted she didn't include them because she thought she wasn't meant to add them.
- Action items from the last meeting.
-  Quarter 3 Budget 
- The new set of onboarders. 
- The Buddy System Reports.
-  Update on the onboarding Skillshare matrix. 
- Suggestions towards better Onboarding processes.
- The onboarding facilitation/documentation roster.

#### Decision Items:
- Following a discussion with the “onboarding WG facilitation/documentation roster,” we decided that we would have two people document meetings (an old member and a new member), and then we would make a comparison between the two summaries — this idea will help first-timers spot their mistakes and improve on their next try. The same goes for meeting facilitation.
  - [rationale] Give people a chance to showcase and learn confidently those skills they're passionate about.
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- In view of the Skillshare matrix document, we have spotted the skills that group members consider to be "core" skills, namely (report writing, documentation/note-taking, facilitation,  community engagement/co-production, understanding decentralized governance, and understanding the ecosystem). We decided to use the skillshare matrix to identify someone in the WG who has any of these skills so he or she would have a session with others to teach the skill(s) to them. However, this decision is also budget-dependent. If we have a good amount after the cut, we can pull this off.

The meeting started with Clement greeting everyone, whilst Ese was not around to greet in all languages, Emmanuel (advanceameyaw) was on the spotlight to greet in his but had background noise challenges.
Action items from the last meeting:
Identify and touch base virtually with other AI/Web3 communities across Africa 
https://www.wada.org/
https://www.wims.io/
African Leadership University (ALE) Rwanda
Sucre and Love to create an onboarding structure for new members (everyone is free to participate) - *Completed*
Clement to conduct research on best countries to spread and penetration strategies (Phase 1 completed) Clement apologized for delays in the second phase of the project due to health issues. He plans to integrate recommendations from the last meeting summary and aims to complete this by the next meeting.

Ayo to create Initiative and Contribution Framework Document.
Ayo emphasized that while the document framework has been established, the focus now shifts from creation to active contribution. Given its comprehensive nature involving multiple sections, Ayo stressed that completing it shouldn't fall solely on one person but should be a collective effort. He highlighted the importance of avoiding redundancy within the document, noting specific sections like onboarding influenced by Sucre n Spice's work and strategy linked to other aspects. Ayo underscored the need for initiative and widespread contribution, proposing a timeline dedicated to collaborative contributions to finalize the document efficiently.

Discussion item: How do we get more African countries to join the guild and participate in the program? (takeaways from suggestions made in last meeting - surveys, merchandise, virtual meets, physical workshops, etc).

Clement recapped the last meeting's takeaways, including conducting surveys and collaborating with other institutions to promote the guild and SingularityNet initiative. He requested input on potential partner organizations and announced that he will create a document for these recommendations in the second phase of research. Clement also reminded the guild to contribute resources to support individual projects that align with the guild's objectives.

Marketing Initiatives for the Guild
Ayo and Clement discussed marketing initiatives for the Guild, including incentivizing quality people to join and creating a template for sourcing individuals from other African countries. Ayo proposed forming a four-person team to work on clear-cut marketing initiatives. So the team comes with a series of marketing initiatives for the next meeting that we all can discuss.

Bounty to upload our past meeting summaries
Clement  suggested uploading past meeting summaries to a summary tool developed by the Archives workgroup and proposed offering a bounty for volunteers interested in this task. Ayo and Isaac volunteered to do that.

AMA Session Update
We reviewed the successful AMA session, which engaged five countries, with active participation from Kenya, Cameroon, and Ghana, and established contact with Rwanda.
Ayo highlighted the need for a larger budget due to the extensive effort involved, with team members dedicating over seven hours each. Contributions from Ese, Clement, Onize and Ayo were praised. Clement emphasized customizing innovations to fit African needs, such as developing an African-specific language model. Overall, the session achieved its goals of outreach and meaningful AI discussions for Africa.

Q3 Budget Updates
Clement noted that recent token prices are unfavorable, necessitating budget adjustments. Sucre suggested postponing final Q3 budget decisions until the treasury clarifies the percentage cut on July 10th, which is expected to be between 23% and 30%. While waiting, Sucre recommended identifying items to potentially reduce. Clement agreed to keep the Q3 budget pending, and Ayo concurred, especially since many guild members were absent. Clement emphasized that swift consent from the first batch of guilds shows strong support for core initiatives, allowing for a focused and strategic budgeting approach essential for solidifying the African guild's structure.


#### Decision Items:
- We agreed to postpone the Q3 Budget for discussion after treasury clarifies the percentage cut.

## Friday 5th July 2024


### Writers Workgroup

- Type of meeting: Weekly
- Present: Kenichi [facilitator], cjfrankie  [documenter], Kenichi, Mikasa, cjfrankie, LadyTempestt, devon, Gorga Siagian, Ayo, Ines, Emmanuel Issac, Advanceameyaw
- Purpose: Regular weekly meeting of the Writers' WorkGroup in the SingularutyNET Ambassador Program
- Working Docs:
  - [WWG Scribbler Onboarding Form](https://forms.gle/yLzrMbtUjjhcgWUj9)

#### Narrative:
The purpose of this meeting was to cite the WWG Q2 journey and how we can move forward progressively. The meeting also focused on the points system allocation from June and Zealy updates.

The meeting started with Kenichi welcoming, and then he mentioned that we only had a few items to discuss on the agenda. He started by citing the WWG Q2 journey and how we can move forward progressively.

Secondly, he mentioned the points system allocation from June and the reward balance in the Treasury. He was impressed with the performances from June, and he pointed out that whether we increase Q3 deliverables or not or our budget gets slashed, we can also visit the points system reserve to draw more pools. He also shed light on the Q3 budget concerns and the need for members to consent to the budget proposal after the meeting.

Following a discussion with the points system, Kenichi shared his screen, and he showcased the publication matrix on Medium. In the month of June, 6 articles were published on the ecosystem page, which amassed 803 reads, amounting to 1.5k views. Owing to the fact that the SingulularityNET community page is still in its infancy, the page has also amassed over 133 views, 71+ reads, and 17 followers. Without hesitation, Advance Ameyaw suggested that we strive to increase the community page engagement and also attract new followers by implementing a system, where people can invite friends and get points. Kenichi appreciated his contribution and said that we already have a system that works, which is Zealy itself, and there is an invite-friend quest on the board!

Progressively, we moved over to the Zealy side of things, and Kenichi announced that the current sprint is 10 days away from ending. Following that, we discussed the X Spanish page; Kenichi also mentioned that he'd love to know how Mikasa and Ines are tracking their activity hours — the need for tracking activity hours is essential because it is part of the concerns that were raised in Q2. He also added that the Scribes and Scribblers should try to attend the governance call whenever concerns like this are raised.

Kenichi emphasized the need for having the “pupil tag,” while stating that we give the tag to people who attend our meetings.  Since our Dework channel is private, people with the pupil tag will be able to see our channel and follow up on discussions around the WWG. More so, Kenichi headed over to the “Scribbler Onboarding Form” to see how many people had filled out the form. We spotted a new response, and we would reach out! Momentarily, Mikasa asked Kenichi why we paused the “biweekly cohort session.” Kenichi cleared the air by saying that people preferred having their onboarding session during the meeting rather than editing documents, he also added that the WWG might reinstate the cohort session once again.

As a matter of finality, Kenichi announced the launch of the new “Mindplex Series: Super AI.” Lastly, he stated that he will work on the first series while other Scribblers will write on the future series yet to come. 



#### Decision Items:
- Following a discussion with Zealy and the SNET community page, Kenichi decided that there should be a Spanish quest tailored to grow the X Spanish.

#### Discussion Points:
- Updates from the Task manager: we had multiple submissions by zalfred, OEP, killy, Lord kizzy (2 long videos and 2clips) which have been posted in the Video WG channel and reviewed by the group.

- Zealy updates: In the previous sprint, 3 videos were posted and new videos were prepared for the next sprint which is starting in 9 days. As regards the claims, Devon is yet to discuss with Kenichi. Devon suggested the Zealy payment could come from the Video WG rather than from the points system of the Writers' WG. Slate asked if there were two allocations for Zealy in the Video WG Budget and Lordkizzy stated that it was just one allocation and it was for the reward distribution for Zealy participation; the payment for the liaison was going to come from the Writers' WG.
-  Discussion on Operations going forward: Lordkizzy laid out some essentials that needed to be implemented going forward. He highlighted the roles and responsibilities of each member and encouraged better submissions for tasks and video contents submissions. He also stated that links to posted videos on our socials should be provided in our content sheet.
- Discussion on Q3 budget and Q2 community concerns: The major discussion was regarding the budget cuts to get our budget fitted. We all had discussions around how we could get the budget fitted; Slate suggested we reduce the amount per video, Malik suggested we take one video person rather than 2 people working on a video.

#### Decision Items:
- We decide to take a pause on video productions and task allocations till we have the exact figure for the cuts, and restructure our Budget based fitted amount 
  - [rationale] Members felt we had a lot of videos that are yet to be uploaded (a total of 13 videos and 4 shorts) so we could keep uploading them while we wait 
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- We decided to have a frequency on how many videos are to be posted per week: the cap was 3 long videos and 2 shorts (including the weekly Town Hall videos)
