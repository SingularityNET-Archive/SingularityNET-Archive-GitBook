#### Decision Items:
- OpenSource paradigm presentation See https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/164 - we decided to look at how the work will be presented after the holidays, in September
  - [rationale] The wish to engage more people with the issues around Open Source culture and ethos
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- Governance WG paying Ese to upload their backlog of summaries to the Tool: Vani Dework task is created, covering 12 meetings at $10 per meeting, and Ese is nearly finished
  - [rationale] Gov WG has budget to cover this, and they have a backlog of summaries written and ready to upload. For the future, summaries are being added to the Tool by other documenters e.g. Ayo
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- we decided that the best way to collect information for the Summary Tool redesign is by brief, targeted 1-2-1 chats with those who use the tool most
  - [rationale] People often do not fill in surveys; plus a survey would not be the best method to reach the core people whose feedback we want
  - [opposing] There was some concern that the budget we have ($100 - reduced due to budget fitting) is quite low for 1-2-1 conversations - but if they are brief and targeted, it should be OK.
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We agreed to pay 4 contributors $25 each for the comments they have added to the AI Ethics policy draft doc. See issue: https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/161 Then in September, we will decide who should work on actually writing the policy; that work will be costed in Q4
  - [rationale] 4 people have made substantial comments in the doc, so the $100 we have for this in Q3 should be shared between them. Vani and Stephen also commented extensively, but are waiving their costs.
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- Summary tool redesign: André has created base components, and added routes to them. Next he will make the navigation more mobile-friendly. See issue https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/181

#### Discussion Points:
- Updates on task management: Malik indicated that he had created the monthly recurrent tasks on Dework and there were 3 new applications which were all rejected after the review process. There was a short clip submitted by Rojo and Lily and it's an animated clip and they requested for $50 per person. The whole group took a look at the video and commended the work but the major concern was the compensation for the work. Lordkizzy made emphasis on the tight budget the video WG are currently working with for Q3 and says it will be outrageous to pay $50 per person ($100) for a clip when we have a budget of $20 each for 12 clips. Lily dropped in and mentioned that the entire video was created from scratch and we should consider it as a long video rather than a clip. Slate indicated that once we pay this out someone can perform similar task and be expecting the same pay which is not feasible for us, so Lordkizzy suggested we compensate their efforts with $30 each and we decided to put it to a poll since the conversation was taking a while. Malik also indicated that he had a discussion with Lordkizzy on the quality of our Town Hall videos 
- Updates on social media management: Tuso indicated that there hasn't been activity from his side, and he had posted the Town Hall videos and two other videos would be posted before the end of the week
- Updates on Zealy: Devon indicated that he had a conversation with Kenichi earlier in the week to present Videos to be created as quests on the Zealy platform which would be commencing next week. Lord kizzy indicated that he also had a conversation with Kenichi to see how Devon could get the editorial access to the Zealy platform but Kenichi highlighted in the discussion that Devon hasn't been active in the Zealy program so it's difficult to grant him the editorial access.
- Discussion on Updates from Lordkizzy and Quality Control Blueprint: Lordkizzy indicated that the current format for our Town Hall Recording is wrong and should be corrected going forward, and he has sent out the correct format to Malik (Task Manager). He also spoke on the  Quality Control discussion from the previous meeting and how this could be implemented, group members shared their thoughts and opinions which will be reflected in the Quality Control Blueprint. 
- Discussion on Budget: Lordkizzy presented the fitted budget to the workgroup and explained the process going forward.
- Strategy Guild Workshop: Ayo suggested that three members should represent the Video WG in this workshop session on Mondays 17:00 UTC 

#### Decision Items:
- We decided to reward Rojo and Lilycupcake $30 each for their amazing video
  - [rationale] We do not have the buget for $50 per person for a 60 secs video
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- We decided that Lordkizzy, Zalfred and Tuso are going to represent the Video WG for the Strategy Guild Workshop

#### Narrative:
KENICHI INTRO: Before the meeting commenced, Kenichi announced that the WWG had selected two new Scribblers and then the Scribes to chase them to get involved; he also mentioned that the Zealy sprint is up and running and the points system for July will be distributed next Tuesday.
 
The meeting kicked off with Cjfrankie welcoming everyone, and then he welcomed and introduced Gorga as one of the newest Scribblers in the WG. Momentarily, Gorga unmutes his mic, and he appreciates everyone for their support and love.

Following that, Mikasa expresses her concerns about the unpublished meeting summaries! July is wrapping up, and the Scribes need to deliver the “SNET Ambassador Program Recap.” Cjfrankie suggests we can get some of the summaries from the meeting tool by navigating down the site to download the PDF version.

Today's meeting marked the presence of Eveline Trinité, who introduced herself and showcased her keen interest in the WG. After the introduction, Mikasa said that she would reach out to her to help her get involved in the WG. In a flash, Merryman also introduced himself, and he expressed interest in contributing to the WG.

Cjfrankie also put AdvanceAmeyaw in the spotlight by asking him how he felt while taking the WG’s test, and he also hinted that the test was quite hard for him! Moved with enthusiasm, Advance asked a question “How does the WWG operate?” And if they also collaborate with the spinoffs. Cjfrankie cleared the air by highlighting the WWG's goals and mission. He also pointed out that the WG has worked with other spin-offs like “Cogito.” We have also written a couple of drafts for Cogito, and we have close contact with Sandra.

MEETING AGENDA: Lady Tempestt emphasized the need for having a structured agenda for our weekly meeting to help us stay organized.

Ayo, from the Strategy Guild, talked about the forthcoming workshop scheduled for the 29th. According to Ayo, the workshop needs 2-3 persons who would represent the WWG in the workshop, and then Mikasa, Cjfrankie, and Gorga expressed their interests.
