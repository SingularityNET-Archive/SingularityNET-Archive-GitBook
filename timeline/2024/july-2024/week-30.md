#### Decision Items:
- OpenSource paradigm presentation See https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/164 - we decided to look at how the work will be presented after the holidays, in September
  - [rationale] The wish to engage more people with the issues around Open Source culture and ethos
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- Governance WG paying Ese to upload their backlog of summaries to the Tool: Vani Dework task is created, covering 12 meetings at $10 per meeting, and Ese is nearly finished
  - [rationale] Gov WG has budget to cover this, and they have a backlog of summaries written and ready to upload. For the future, summaries are being added to the Tool by other documenters e.g. Ayo
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- we decided that the best way to collect information for the Summary Tool redesign is by brief, targeted 1-2-1 chats with those who use the tool most
  - [rationale] People often do not fill in surveys; plus a survey would not be the best method to reach the core people whose feedback we want
  - [opposing] There was some concern that the budget we have ($100 - reduced due to budget fitting) is quite low for 1-2-1 conversations - but if they are brief and targeted, it should be OK.
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We agreed to pay 4 contributors $25 each for the comments they have added to the AI Ethics policy draft doc. See issue: https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/161 Then in September, we will decide who should work on actually writing the policy; that work will be costed in Q4
  - [rationale] 4 people have made substantial comments in the doc, so the $100 we have for this in Q3 should be shared between them. Vani and Stephen also commented extensively, but are waiving their costs.
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- Summary tool redesign: André has created base components, and added routes to them. Next he will make the navigation more mobile-friendly. See issue https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/181
