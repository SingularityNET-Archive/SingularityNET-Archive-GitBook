The importance of the research and workshop for Q3 was highlighted.
Research - Contributing to the survey questions is the first step in expressing interest in joining the research team.
Workshop - Getting two or three representatives from each guild (Marketing, Video, and Writers WG) is the first action item.
Ayo reinforced the Guild’s inclusive principle.

Adoption of Tools
The use of GitHub in the Guild will be explored and members should share their email addresses or reach out to Ayo in DM to be added to the group.

#### Decision Items:
- OpenSource paradigm presentation See https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/164 - we decided to look at how the work will be presented after the holidays, in September
  - [rationale] The wish to engage more people with the issues around Open Source culture and ethos
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- Governance WG paying Ese to upload their backlog of summaries to the Tool: Vani Dework task is created, covering 12 meetings at $10 per meeting, and Ese is nearly finished
  - [rationale] Gov WG has budget to cover this, and they have a backlog of summaries written and ready to upload. For the future, summaries are being added to the Tool by other documenters e.g. Ayo
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- we decided that the best way to collect information for the Summary Tool redesign is by brief, targeted 1-2-1 chats with those who use the tool most
  - [rationale] People often do not fill in surveys; plus a survey would not be the best method to reach the core people whose feedback we want
  - [opposing] There was some concern that the budget we have ($100 - reduced due to budget fitting) is quite low for 1-2-1 conversations - but if they are brief and targeted, it should be OK.
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We agreed to pay 4 contributors $25 each for the comments they have added to the AI Ethics policy draft doc. See issue: https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/161 Then in September, we will decide who should work on actually writing the policy; that work will be costed in Q4
  - [rationale] 4 people have made substantial comments in the doc, so the $100 we have for this in Q3 should be shared between them. Vani and Stephen also commented extensively, but are waiving their costs.
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- Summary tool redesign: André has created base components, and added routes to them. Next he will make the navigation more mobile-friendly. See issue https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/181

- Welcoming new members and Introduction
- Review of last meeting summary Action Items
- UPDATE STATUS ON DEVELOPMENT TO FILL REPOS! 
- SHOWCASE FINISHED PROPOSAL
- NEW OPERATIONS SYSTEM GOING FORWARD

#### Discussion Points:
- SHOWCASE FINISHED PROPOSAL: We are trying to present deliverables on completed projects to the community. We weren't able to further discuss this because core members of respective projects weren't in attendance 
- LAST MEETING FOLLOW UP: FOLLOW UP DISCUSSIONS ON NEW OPERATIONS OBJECTIVES, DESIGN NEW OPERATIONS SYSTEM / R&D Guild Going Forward:   Guillermo highlighted the need for proper reporting and documentation and also the need for only core contributors to be able to present proposals; if an existing member that isn't yet a core contributor wants to present a proposal, they must have a core contributor on their team. We also believe that community voting gives us a precise scope on what the community needs and how it gets implemented, also it helps to avoid overlapping between proposals with other Guilds. 
- Discussions on the voting system for proposals: we highlighted that Core Contributors will be allowed to VOTE due to their extensive knowledge of the ecosystem and its gonna be 1 person one vote, and a percentage quorum for proposals
-  Skills Collaboration Database: The last part of the development of this project is going to be assigned to AJ for completion and AJ presented what he has worked on over the week and requested for assistance on the BackEnd development for the project.
- Discussions on provision of incentives for contributions: Kenichi suggested an incentive for the first 3 members that participate in the Research survey form for Guilds and workgroups, and asked if they could be rewarded by the end of the month rather than quarterly. Lord kizzy requested for more time to discuss this internally and get Kenichi a feed back
-  Voting Pools: Kenichi highlighted the need for this, so that proposals might align with a precise scope 
- Vasu presented a project on "SingularityNet's ChatGPT " to the guild for testing and reviews

#### Decision Items:
- We decided that AJ was going to continue the "Skills Collaboration Database" previously done by Curtis 
  - [rationale] This selection was done based on AJ's skills and also due to lack of communication with Curtis
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup

## Friday 26th July 2024


### Video Workgroup

- Type of meeting: Weekly
- Present: Zalfred [facilitator], lord kizzy [documenter], hogantuso, Slate, malik, killy, Zalfred, lord kizzy, AndrewBen, RealMoyo, Ayodele, Rojo, lilycupcake, osmium, DevonHardy, Advanceameyaw, oep
- Purpose: Weekly updates 
- Working Docs:
  - [Video Workgroup Budget Request Q3](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gkLF0ymOATPQu_jAWSL1u9QH6OcOIQEClF9ExL6RJQk/edit?gid=0#gid=0)
  - [Video Workgroup Q2 Report.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r5BG6w-sdOEoda3sKwIRWtfLioCBGw5sof4tCrnIuac/edit#heading=h.1ooa0j1dxhvv)
  - [Video WG Content Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xqbs48KnfMBY_NgMp_Vo48dHrkEpr_bCM0KfL7x7z4k/edit?gid=371334120#gid=371334120)

#### Discussion Points:
- Updates on task management: Malik indicated that he had created the monthly recurrent tasks on Dework and there were 3 new applications which were all rejected after the review process. There was a short clip submitted by Rojo and Lily and it's an animated clip and they requested for $50 per person. The whole group took a look at the video and commended the work but the major concern was the compensation for the work. Lordkizzy made emphasis on the tight budget the video WG are currently working with for Q3 and says it will be outrageous to pay $50 per person ($100) for a clip when we have a budget of $20 each for 12 clips. Lily dropped in and mentioned that the entire video was created from scratch and we should consider it as a long video rather than a clip. Slate indicated that once we pay this out someone can perform similar task and be expecting the same pay which is not feasible for us, so Lordkizzy suggested we compensate their efforts with $30 each and we decided to put it to a poll since the conversation was taking a while. Malik also indicated that he had a discussion with Lordkizzy on the quality of our Town Hall videos 
- Updates on social media management: Tuso indicated that there hasn't been activity from his side, and he had posted the Town Hall videos and two other videos would be posted before the end of the week
- Updates on Zealy: Devon indicated that he had a conversation with Kenichi earlier in the week to present Videos to be created as quests on the Zealy platform which would be commencing next week. Lord kizzy indicated that he also had a conversation with Kenichi to see how Devon could get the editorial access to the Zealy platform but Kenichi highlighted in the discussion that Devon hasn't been active in the Zealy program so it's difficult to grant him the editorial access.
- Discussion on Updates from Lordkizzy and Quality Control Blueprint: Lordkizzy indicated that the current format for our Town Hall Recording is wrong and should be corrected going forward, and he has sent out the correct format to Malik (Task Manager). He also spoke on the  Quality Control discussion from the previous meeting and how this could be implemented, group members shared their thoughts and opinions which will be reflected in the Quality Control Blueprint. 
- Discussion on Budget: Lordkizzy presented the fitted budget to the workgroup and explained the process going forward.
- Strategy Guild Workshop: Ayo suggested that three members should represent the Video WG in this workshop session on Mondays 17:00 UTC

#### Narrative:
KENICHI INTRO: Before the meeting commenced, Kenichi announced that the WWG had selected two new Scribblers and then the Scribes to chase them to get involved; he also mentioned that the Zealy sprint is up and running and the points system for July will be distributed next Tuesday.
 
The meeting kicked off with Cjfrankie welcoming everyone, and then he welcomed and introduced Gorga as one of the newest Scribblers in the WG. Momentarily, Gorga unmutes his mic, and he appreciates everyone for their support and love.

Following that, Mikasa expresses her concerns about the unpublished meeting summaries! July is wrapping up, and the Scribes need to deliver the “SNET Ambassador Program Recap.” Cjfrankie suggests we can get some of the summaries from the meeting tool by navigating down the site to download the PDF version.

Today's meeting marked the presence of Eveline Trinité, who introduced herself and showcased her keen interest in the WG. After the introduction, Mikasa said that she would reach out to her to help her get involved in the WG. In a flash, Merryman also introduced himself, and he expressed interest in contributing to the WG.

Cjfrankie also put AdvanceAmeyaw in the spotlight by asking him how he felt while taking the WG’s test, and he also hinted that the test was quite hard for him! Moved with enthusiasm, Advance asked a question “How does the WWG operate?” And if they also collaborate with the spinoffs. Cjfrankie cleared the air by highlighting the WWG's goals and mission. He also pointed out that the WG has worked with other spin-offs like “Cogito.” We have also written a couple of drafts for Cogito, and we have close contact with Sandra.

MEETING AGENDA: Lady Tempestt emphasized the need for having a structured agenda for our weekly meeting to help us stay organized.

Ayo, from the Strategy Guild, talked about the forthcoming workshop scheduled for the 29th. According to Ayo, the workshop needs 2-3 persons who would represent the WWG in the workshop, and then Mikasa, Cjfrankie, and Gorga expressed their interests.

#### Discussion Points:
- Slate outlined the meeting agenda
- Malik updated us on the education guild department, highlighting the welcoming reception area and the questions that can be asked to the NPC in the reception, which is slate. He also presented a hologram themed around twin protocol and a hall displaying infographics about spin-offs. (Watch the education guild video in the drive folder link under the media section)
- Martinsoki updated on the Treasury guild's progress, showcasing the guild building and its outdoor swimming pool, as well as the NPCs. He mentioned facing challenges in editing the department due to communication issues with his partner and are still in progress.  (Watch the Treasury guild video in the drive folder link under the media section)
- Gorga updated on the archives workgroup's formation, showcasing the NPCs and noting that the building's interior is still under construction. Members noted similarities to the video workgroup building, but Gorga asserted it was different, and Slate remarked that the building shouldn’t be too tall, as VR requires specific height constraints. (Watch the Archives Workgroup video in the drive folder link under the media section)
- Photogee updated us on the Dework PBL creation. They've replaced the anime NPCs with standard ones but didn't provide names, as the information document from Slate only listed one member, Tevo. They haven't started animating the characters due to health issues. He showcased the building and the playground behind it, demonstrated a device for teleporting to the upper floor, and expressed his desire to create a workstation. Malik thought the chairs were floating because the second floor was transparent.  (Watch the DeworkPBL video in the drive folder link under the media section)
- Gorga showcased his segment of the video WG creation, highlighting NPC animations and dialogues. One NPC was turned to face the wall, but Slate suggested turning him around to face the entering players, which was implemented. Slate also recommended that dialogue pop-ups should only appear during interactions and proposed adding more animations for the NPCs.
- Lord Kizzy presented his segment of the video WG creation, featuring various NPC animations and dialogues. He demonstrated the dialogue system with the Rojo NPC. Devon recommended breaking Rojo's lengthy responses into smaller segments for clarity.
- OEP and CollyPride did not demonstrate their progress in department creation.
- It was discussed whether we needed a holiday, and the majority of members responded affirmatively.

#### Decision Items:
- Building should not be too big
  - [rationale]  VR requires specific height constraints.
- The next meeting is canceled due to the holiday.
  - [rationale] To give the Department creators sufficient time to complete their work.
