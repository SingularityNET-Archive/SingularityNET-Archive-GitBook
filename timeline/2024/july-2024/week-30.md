#### Narrative:
Action Items Checkboxes from the last meeting
Ayo led the discussion on the action items from the previous meeting.
The focus was on the completion of the Guild working documents and the development of survey questions. 
Only 3 people had filled out the working document at the time of the meeting.

Onboard New Members/Core Member Roll Call
This is a new segment introduced to acknowledge new core members, onboard first-timers, and explain how everyone can contribute and be a part of what is happening within the Guild. 

Q3 for the Guild in Perspective
The importance of the research and workshop for Q3 was highlighted.
Research - Contributing to the survey questions is the first step in expressing interest in joining the research team.
Workshop - Getting two or three representatives from each guild (Marketing, Video, and Writers WG) is the first action item.
Ayo reinforced the Guild’s inclusive principle.

Adoption of Tools
The use of GitHub in the Guild will be explored and members should share their email addresses or reach out to Ayo in DM to be added to the group.

Guild Leadership
Leadership structure was discussed, with emphasis on decentralized leadership structure, and active member participation.

#### Decision Items:
- OpenSource paradigm presentation See https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/164 - we decided to look at how the work will be presented after the holidays, in September
  - [rationale] The wish to engage more people with the issues around Open Source culture and ethos
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- Governance WG paying Ese to upload their backlog of summaries to the Tool: Vani Dework task is created, covering 12 meetings at $10 per meeting, and Ese is nearly finished
  - [rationale] Gov WG has budget to cover this, and they have a backlog of summaries written and ready to upload. For the future, summaries are being added to the Tool by other documenters e.g. Ayo
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- we decided that the best way to collect information for the Summary Tool redesign is by brief, targeted 1-2-1 chats with those who use the tool most
  - [rationale] People often do not fill in surveys; plus a survey would not be the best method to reach the core people whose feedback we want
  - [opposing] There was some concern that the budget we have ($100 - reduced due to budget fitting) is quite low for 1-2-1 conversations - but if they are brief and targeted, it should be OK.
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We agreed to pay 4 contributors $25 each for the comments they have added to the AI Ethics policy draft doc. See issue: https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/161 Then in September, we will decide who should work on actually writing the policy; that work will be costed in Q4
  - [rationale] 4 people have made substantial comments in the doc, so the $100 we have for this in Q3 should be shared between them. Vani and Stephen also commented extensively, but are waiving their costs.
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- Summary tool redesign: André has created base components, and added routes to them. Next he will make the navigation more mobile-friendly. See issue https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/181
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
