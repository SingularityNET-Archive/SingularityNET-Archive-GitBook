#### Narrative:
Fill in your usernames for Github and Discord on AI Ethics Workgroup TAG username list spreadsheet

Peter has created an AI Ethics Forum for open discussion, in the General area. To be heavily moderated with notice at top saying only AI Ethics Discussions -no other conversations. Moderators TBD but Clement was interested

Q3 Workgoup Admin Roles - Duke declined "co-chair mentee" position and passed role to Colleen
Clement did not receive any comments in spreadsheet nor this meeting

Roles confirmed as:
 - Co-chair GEI: Vani
 - Co-chair role mentee: Colleen
 - Reportbacks to GEI meetings: Jenn
 - WG Async work support: LadyTempestt
 - Internal WG management: Sucre


Now that Sucre is confirmed as internal WG manager, she will be prepping agendas and facilitating meetings, not Vani

AGI2024: Budget will not allow for many people to be funded for travel to the conference - TBD- LeeLoo will find out more

Q3 Budget fitting - (need to lose c. $1500, exact amount TBC) - halving the number of community interviews or moving some to Q4; "producing resources to demystify AI terminology" could be moved to Q4 as well

Informal AI Ethic Chats with a least 2 people and data involved - put ideas on "AI Ethics WG Stuff!" spreadsheet

We are changing task tracking from Dework to Github - see project board here https://github.com/orgs/SingularityNet-Ambassador-Program/projects/1/views/2 Please add both your usernames for Discord and Github to AI Ethics WG tag and username list, to be invited to GitHub organisation and be able to be assigned to tasks. Some invitations have already gone out - check your email.

Changing this meeting time to 14 UTC (this was agreed last meeting, but Vani forgot!)

Which Ambassadors will be funded for travel to AGI2024 in August - Budget concerns

Ambassador travel needs to be decided on earlier in the year - how early? 6 months?

Those working on Strategy drafting Teams (writing and editing groups) should ideally create Discord private chat groups to progress their work and liaise. LadyTempestt will offer support as needed. 






#### Decision Items:
- New AI Ethics Forum has been created
  - [rationale] Note at top of channel saying AI Ethics discussions only, all other conversation will be deleted
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- Fewer people than originally thought will go to AGI2024 due to budget restrictions. Travel to any future AI Conferences needs to be decided farther ahead in the future
  - [rationale] to allow people time to get visas if needed
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- Budget fitting cuts will likely include the item for creating learning resources, and halving the number of interviews to be done with the public
  - [rationale] More interviews can be done in Q4; and we could move learning resources to Q4 because then we'll have a better idea of what kinds of resources might be needed
