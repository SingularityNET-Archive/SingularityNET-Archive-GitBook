#### Narrative:
Fill in your usernames for Github and Discord on AI Ethics Workgroup TAG username list spreadsheet

Peter has created an AI Ethics Forum for open discussion, in the General area. To be heavily moderated with notice at top saying only AI Ethics Discussions -no other conversations. Moderators TBD but Clement was interested

Q3 Workgoup Admin Roles - Duke declined "co-chair mentee" position and passed role to Colleen
Clement did not receive any comments in spreadsheet nor this meeting

Roles confirmed as:
 - Co-chair GEI: Vani
 - Co-chair role mentee: Colleen
 - Reportbacks to GEI meetings: Jenn
 - WG Async work support: LadyTempestt
 - Internal WG management: Sucre


Now that Sucre is confirmed as internal WG manager, she will be prepping agendas and facilitating meetings, not Vani

AGI2024: Budget will not allow for many people to be funded for travel to the conference - TBD- LeeLoo will find out more

Q3 Budget fitting - (need to lose c. $1500, exact amount TBC) - halving the number of community interviews or moving some to Q4; "producing resources to demystify AI terminology" could be moved to Q4 as well

Informal AI Ethic Chats with a least 2 people and data involved - put ideas on "AI Ethics WG Stuff!" spreadsheet

We are changing task tracking from Dework to Github - see project board here https://github.com/orgs/SingularityNet-Ambassador-Program/projects/1/views/2 Please add both your usernames for Discord and Github to AI Ethics WG tag and username list, to be invited to GitHub organisation and be able to be assigned to tasks. Some invitations have already gone out - check your email.

Changing this meeting time to 14 UTC (this was agreed last meeting, but Vani forgot!)

Which Ambassadors will be funded for travel to AGI2024 in August - Budget concerns

Ambassador travel needs to be decided on earlier in the year - how early? 6 months?

Those working on Strategy drafting Teams (writing and editing groups) should ideally create Discord private chat groups to progress their work and liaise. LadyTempestt will offer support as needed.

#### Decision Items:
- OpenSource paradigm presentation See https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/164 - TBD next meeting (24th July) how the work will be presented
  - [rationale] The wish to engage more people with the issues around Open Source culture and ethos
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- Governance WG paying Ese to upload their backlog of summaries to the Tool: Vani has messaged Felix to ask him to create a Dework task for it
  - [rationale] Gov WG has budget to cover this, and they have summaries written and ready to upload, so Dework task is needed since they manage their budget on Dework
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- André demo'd the new Docs Management tool https://snet-doc-manager.netlify.app/#
  - [rationale] explaining how we will manage and open-source docs submitted in meeting summaries
- As planned, André has created a doc ("New Summary Tool Features") collating ideas for the redesign of the summary tool. People who work with the community on using the tool (e.g. Vani, Onyeka) to add any issues they hear about (especially because, due to budget fitting, we might not be able to afford to do as much organised community engagement around this as we would have liked).
  - [rationale] To start organising ideas for changes and hearing from the community, without necessarily doing direct engagement work.
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- RE video walkthru of how to use the GitHub Board - see https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/116   Duke has reassigned it to Ayo, but we agreed there are a few issues with Ayo's first draft - may need an edit. We agreed Vani will DM Ayo.
  - [rationale] Mainly that it is a bit generic, rather than focusing on how *we* in this WG use our GitHub board; and that the voiceover doesn't explain sufficiently what's being done
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- The work on the Archives Backlog - some people have had to do more work than others for the same pay, as the month they were working on had more meetings to cover. After discussion both in the meeting and earlier in the Discord chat for the group who are working on it, we agreed to keep the money allocation as it is, even though it's not ideal and somewhat unfair; but for future tasks we'll bear this  kind of issue in mind and allocate it better from the start
  - [rationale] Because working it out per meeting uploaded would be a disproportionate amount of work
  - [opposing] There were suggestions to try and work it out differently, but people decided it was easiest to leave it as it is.
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- We agreed that for the "Good Meeting Summaries" task in Q3, Sucre, Clement and Onyeka will continue as the judging team
  - [rationale] For continuity, as they've just established how to run the competition smoothly. Maybe hand over next quarter if we continue with the competition in Q4.
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- Holiday: We agreed that we will meet on 24th August as planned, but then will *not* meet in August (meeting dates would have been 7th and 21st Aug). So we return on 4th Sept.
  - [rationale] Because several people are away for parts of August, so easiest approach is to take a break.
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup

We explored the potential of using AI for data analysis and intelligence, recognizing its value in making informed decisions. Facilitating documented work processes was highlighted as essential for maintaining clarity and consistency in our tasks. We also discussed the idea of using tokens or AGX to reward participants in on-chain governance, proposing a system where tokens could be used to vote on activities. Additionally, we addressed translation tasks and the associated rewards, aiming to create an inclusive and participatory framework for all team members.

We acknowledged the potential for power imbalances but focused on building a community where members are actively involved in decision-making through reputation systems and token incentives. Understanding the system's objectives and mechanisms was deemed crucial, and we emphasized that while newcomers are respected, tasks should be assigned based on merit. We also discussed using token-based systems to measure contributions and creativity within the ambassadors' global program, incentivizing new members through rewards for participation and engagement.

#### In this meeting we discussed:
- Minutes from the last meeting and action items; we agreed to the minutes of last meeting.
- Onboarding Journeys update: Onize wasn't able to present the scripts in the meeting but there were also some discussions on the format we are going to use to if we are going to  publicize the scripts (a video or rather infographics). Sucre will look at the budget to see which is feasible.
- Skills Matrix: Vani wanted to know what are two skills we will to select to organize mentorship for Q3 in the group
- Q3 budget: Since the total requested across all WGs is higher than the total available, budget-fitting will need to be implemented. The lowering percentage is yet to be determined since some workgroup budgets are yet to be approved, but we will get less than we asked for. Sucre is to take a look at the budget to see how we could prioritize activities.
- Onboarders Team: Sucre explained the entire process (There is going be a new Discord channel and also note that new people get a Discord tag which will be removed once they become a Core contributor. Also the FAQ will be updated once the ASI migration is completed. See ONBOARDING document
- Facilitation / Documentation Roster: There were some discussions around who the next facilitator and documenter was going to be. From the roster is going to be Duke facilitating and Lady Tempestt documenting and they both indicated that they would be up for it.
- Gorga alleged that he had been passed over in the assignment of tasks such as documenting due to xenophobia, prejudice and favouritism, and that the workgroup's practices were untransparent. People in the meeting addressed and refuted these allegations in the Zoom chat - see doc "Onboarding meeting Chat, 27th June 2024 - Gorga"
- August Break: Vani highlighted that many members of the ambassador program were going on a summer break and wanted to know if we would continue having meetings, she also proposed we could use some of the August sessions for skills training sessions. Lordkizzy indicated that we should try to see if those interested in the training session would be available during this period. We decided to continue the conversation in the next meeting.
- Discussions on Gorga's accusations and comments on the Workgroup: we decided to for Sucre to reach out to Gorga and see if he would be available for the next meeting and then make further discussions on this.

#### Decision Items:
- We agreed on Documentation as the first skill to organize mentorship for in Q3 and then GitHub Operations afterwards 
  - [rationale] We had quite a large number for report writing but we noticed that no one has  said in the skills matrix doc that they are interested in learning the skill. Since we plan to have a mentorship session next month for documentation we could just make that the first skill to learn.

### Africa Guild

- Type of meeting: Weekly
- Present: Duke [facilitator], esewilliams [documenter], Sucre n Spice, esewilliams, Isaac, Duke, Ayo, Photogee, AdvanceAmeyaw, Isaac Daniel

General Summary:

Clement Umoh raised concerns about the recurring scheduling conflicts and suggested finding a permanent solution to avoid wasting time. Duke proposed two options to address scheduling conflicts: complaining to Governance WG or changing the meeting time. These were put to a vote, with the group ultimately deciding to move the meeting to 5 p.m. on Thursdays.

The group discussed plans for the AI Ethics Expo in Nigeria, a collaboration between the AI Ethics Work Group and the African Guild. The event is projected for August or September, with a focus on securing a suitable venue and speakers, and a budget split between the two groups. It will be the group's first outreach initiative. Ese Williams questioned the roles of the four participants for the Expo, leading to a discussion on the implementation of proposed ideas and the need for volunteers to assist with the event. The conversation also addressed the selection process, potential locations for the event, and the possibility of covering travel expenses for participants.

The importance of the members' collective initiative was highlighted for generating ideas to drive the guild forward. The initiative aims to fund ideas from guild members to contribute to the guild's growth and achievement of KPIs.

Duke addressed the need to revise budgets due to pending budget approvals for Strategy, Marketing, and Writers. Budget cuts are expected; careful spending will be important this quarter, as the current budget lacks contingency provisions. The discussion also touched on the majority of the budget being allocated to recurring operational work.

Duke asked for feedback on the African Guild's progress, with Clement Umoh and Ese Williams expressing positive feedback and Ese suggesting improvements in organization and time management. Duke sought opinions on the pace of progress and the need for better coordination, and mentioned the possibility of giveaways for consistent meeting attendance. 

Ese Williams expressed confusion about the AAG token and its legitimacy, prompting Clement Umoh to caution against engaging with it. 

The discussion also included updates on uploading past meeting summaries and the need to ideate on strategies to increase African participation in the guild.

The meeting concluded with plans for future meetings and a reminder to communicate any scheduling conflicts.



#### Decision Items:
- Should the meeting time be moved to a different day?
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup

### Video Workgroup

- Type of meeting: Weekly
- Present: Zalfred [facilitator], lord kizzy [documenter], hogantuso, Slate, malik, killy, Zalfred, lord kizzy, Advanceameyaw

#### Discussion Points:
- Updates on task management: Slate shared some issues with the Town Hall editing task and also the Town Hall Summary video: assignees didn't follow the guidelines and tasks were late. Slate had a call with the Social Media manager (Malik) on how to streamline the process for these tasks, and now all issues have been resolved and the video links have been added to the content sheet.
- Updates on social media management: Malik mentioned that 3 long videos and 3 shorts (including the Town Hall videos) were posted within the week.
- Updates on Zealy: Lordkizzy highlighted that he had separate calls with Kenichi and Devon within the week and reached an agreement with the Writers' WG in regard to the payment for the liaison role: Devon will be paid from the Writers' WG points system in Q3 but in Q4 there will be an allocation for the liaison role in the Video WG budget. Kenichi is going to study the next two sprints to get the exact figure for the payment, so that we won't be over-paying or under-paying anyone. Secondly, Lordkizzy indicated that Devon sent out 5 long videos and 5 shorts in the previous sprint to Kenichi but only 3 long videos were created as quests, so going forward Lordkizzy has made emphasis on Devon completing the training and getting editorial access to the Zealy platform.
- Discussion on Operations going forward: Lord kizzy suggested that we include new columns in our content sheet for Tiktok and Instagram links and Zealy Quest creation. Lordkizzy highlighted that there is a need for more participation in meetings since that is the environment where most decisions are made, and going forward he will try to see if the Video WG could adopt the Treasury system for task assignments rather than assigning members that are not up to speed on the conversation and decisions made by the Video WG.
- Discussion on Budget: Lordkizzy and slate indicated that some other work groups are yet to get consent and that we should wait for one more week before making decisions. 
- Discussion on Quality Control: Malik suggested that we audit scripts before the video creation, zalfred suggested that we should rather make it a priority for members to give meaningful feedback while giving consent to videos. Malik also highlighted that the majority of members rarely consent to videos and asked how that can be improved. Lordkizzy suggested providing incentives ($5) to members for meaningful feedback on scripts and videos, that way we would get enough feedback on videos and ensure that the quality of videos is controlled. This will be implemented in Q4.
- Discussion on Vacation: the Video WG is going to have further discussions on this in the next meeting.
- Migration of Video WG calls to Zoom rather than Discord: Tuso was of the opinion that we should migrate to Zoom since majority of the Workgroups and Guilds are currently using Discord, some members still preferred Discord but we decided to continue the conversation in the next meeting. 

#### Decision Items:
- We decided to have further discussions on restructuring of the Q3 Budget in the next call 
  - [rationale] We want to be sure of the exact figure for the budget cuts

### Writers Workgroup

- Type of meeting: Weekly
- Present: Kenichi [facilitator], cjfrankie  [documenter], Kenichi, Mikasa, cjfrankie, LadyTempestt, devon, Gorga Siagian, Ayo, Emmanuel Issac, Slate, AJ, kateri
- Purpose: Regular weekly meeting of the Writers' WorkGroup in the SingularutyNET Ambassador Program, discuss on timestamped video shorts collaboration with the video workgroup and thrilling discussion centered around Zealy.
- Working Docs:
  - [WWG Scribbler Onboarding Form](https://forms.gle/yLzrMbtUjjhcgWUj9)

#### Narrative:
The meeting started with Kenichi welcoming everyone to the meeting: following that, Kenichi surfed the Dework board to see all the tasks' progress. Firstly, Emmanuel Isaac and Mikasa shared an update from the Twitter management side of things. Emmanuel said that he has submitted the KPI for Q3, and he has created a draft for the content calendar which will start rolling out next week.

Secondly, Kenichi raised a discussion on the recent test taken by WWG aspirants — he also pointed out that the aspirants should enable suggestion mode to reflect the actual changes that they made. The aspirants should also open edit access and follow the exact instructions that were mentioned in the test. So far, three scribblers have reviewed the test done by Nengi and Gorga, while Kenichi will do the aggregate to show their total score, and if they reach the threshold, they will be welcomed to the WG.

Kenichi also pointed out some slips from Slate's article “Medical Advisor Roundtable: Chronic Disease” and why he still needs to make changes to the document. Kenichi also emphasized the need for more Twitter threads, and he also pointed out that Twitter threads aren't exclusive to Mikasa; other scribblers can find interesting topics and then showcase them during meetings.

We discussed “timestamped video shorts", and how we can embed them within our Medium articles to increase traction and engagement. Kenichi added that he will create a list of all the pending drafts and then give the video to WG. Devon asked, “What kind of videos?” Kenichi answered by saying that the shorts would be created from existing videos and would be no longer than 1 minute and 30 seconds. Lady Tempestt added that the scribblers should decide which part is the most captivating in a video, and then the video gets a timestamp. 

We started a thrilling discussion centered around Zealy; thankfully, the current sprint is ending in a few days! Kenichi also shared insider tips on the sprinters' matrix;  the current sprint has 36+ participants. We also talked about restructuring the Zealy rewards. Here’s the breakdown: the top 5 get $30 each, the next 5 get $20 each, the next 10 get $10 each, and 10 random people will earn $10 each. This decision was made to incentivize more people for their participation and time.

As a matter of finality, Ayo added that we should always give consent to new proposals to enable them to pass. He also spilled the beans by giving us insider tips from the Strategy Guild. The guild is looking forward to hosting a workshop that will involve the Writers' WG and video WG in their pipeline — more updates will be coming soon!


#### Decision Items:
- In view of Dework priority bars, we decided that moving forward, Scribblers should pay close attention to the priority bars: any tasks that exceed the submission date will be assigned to another available scribbler to avoid delay! 
  - [rationale] This decision was made to prevent any delay that may disrupt the overall impact of the workgroup 
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- We have decided to incorporate “video shorts” within Medium articles to increase traction and engagement.
  - [rationale] To increase traction and engagement.

  - [rationale] We want to spread the reward between 30 sprinters to incentivize their efforts and time.
