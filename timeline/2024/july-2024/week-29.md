Becoming a Strategy Guild Core Member
Ayo explained why the guild has a set of unique core member requirements as represented in the Strategy Guild Membership document

Budget Proposal Update
The Guild budget was already technically approved based on the open treasury session but concerns on the Guild’s budget needed to be documented in the next governance meeting. Ayo encouraged all core contributors to attend to their consenting responsibilities.

Q3 in Perspective 
Ayo explained that there are only two objectives for the Guild in Q3: 1) to understand the needs of the program and how contributors in the program expect the Guild to function; 2) to facilitate a workshop in partnership with Writers and Video Workgroups and Marketing Guild. Ayo shared that the Q3 report will be based on the outcome of these two objectives.

Discussion on Survey Ideas and Participation
There are two open documents to which people are expected to contribute. The Possible Survey Questions [Strategy Guild] and the Strategy Guild Working Document.

Discussion on Tools and Meeting Time
After contributions from Ayo and Clement, consensus was that the Guild will be open to exploring whatever tools can best serve the interest and uniqueness of the Guild. The meeting will remain at 4pm UTC weekly on Mondays.


Discussion on Guild Leadership and Rotating Facilitation

- Type of meeting: Weekly

- Working Docs:
  - [WWG Scribbler Onboarding Form](https://forms.gle/yLzrMbtUjjhcgWUj9)

#### Narrative:
The meeting started with Kenichi welcoming everyone to the meeting! We kicked things off from the Zealy side of things; thankfully, the Zealy sprint has ended, however, the random winners🏆 haven't been announced yet. Momentarily, Kenichi added that the next sprint should start immediately — July 22nd, to be precise. Kenichi also suggested that we should repeat some quests from last quarter; he also hinted that the last sprint had a low turnout rate and a decline in participation compared to other springs.

Dework update: Cjfrankie and Devon shared updates on the current tasks assigned to them.

Following that, Kenichi called the Scribblers' attention to the community page, and he added that the community page is out of draft. He also encouraged the Scribes to source more drafts. Kenichi added that he would dig into the inventory to source old, unpublished articles pending the time when new drafts will be ready! 

From a bird’s-eye view, July looks like a transformative month for the WWG: we crossed our KPI of 200 followers on the ambassador Medium page, but we're not stopping there! We need more people to engage with our content.

Peer Review: Following a discussion with the Writers' WG test submission, Kenichi still emphasized the need for using suggestion mode to edit drafts so that the writers can see what changes were made. Kenichi also commended Nengi for her test;  momentarily, he announced that Nengi is now officially a Scribbler and that he will get the Scribbler tag for her. He also encouraged the Scribes to keep sharing the WWG Scribbler Onboarding Form since we haven't reached our onboarding number for Q3.

Following the revamped marketing guild, marketing wants to join forces with the writers' workgroup. To this effect, Kenichi proposed a giveaway or airdrop initiative where people with the highest Zealy points get rewarded.
