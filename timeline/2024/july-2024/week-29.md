Becoming a Strategy Guild Core Member
Ayo explained why the guild has a set of unique core member requirements as represented in the Strategy Guild Membership document

Budget Proposal Update
The Guild budget was already technically approved based on the open treasury session but concerns on the Guild’s budget needed to be documented in the next governance meeting. Ayo encouraged all core contributors to attend to their consenting responsibilities.

Q3 in Perspective 
Ayo explained that there are only two objectives for the Guild in Q3: 1) to understand the needs of the program and how contributors in the program expect the Guild to function; 2) to facilitate a workshop in partnership with Writers and Video Workgroups and Marketing Guild. Ayo shared that the Q3 report will be based on the outcome of these two objectives.

Discussion on Survey Ideas and Participation
There are two open documents to which people are expected to contribute. The Possible Survey Questions [Strategy Guild] and the Strategy Guild Working Document.

Discussion on Tools and Meeting Time
After contributions from Ayo and Clement, consensus was that the Guild will be open to exploring whatever tools can best serve the interest and uniqueness of the Guild. The meeting will remain at 4pm UTC weekly on Mondays.


Discussion on Guild Leadership and Rotating Facilitation
