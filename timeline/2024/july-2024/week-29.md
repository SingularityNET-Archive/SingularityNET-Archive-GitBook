#### Narrative:
Becoming a Strategy Guild Core Member
Ayo explained why the guild has a set of unique core member requirements as represented in the Strategy Guild Membership document

Budget Proposal Update
The Guild budget was already technically approved based on the open treasury session but concerns on the Guild’s budget needed to be documented in the next governance meeting. Ayo encouraged all core contributors to attend to their consenting responsibilities.

Q3 in Perspective 
Ayo explained that there are only two objectives for the Guild in Q3: 1) to understand the needs of the program and how contributors in the program expect the Guild to function; 2) to facilitate a workshop in partnership with Writers and Video Workgroups and Marketing Guild. Ayo shared that the Q3 report will be based on the outcome of these two objectives.

Discussion on Survey Ideas and Participation
There are two open documents to which people are expected to contribute. The Possible Survey Questions [Strategy Guild] and the Strategy Guild Working Document.

Discussion on Tools and Meeting Time
After contributions from Ayo and Clement, consensus was that the Guild will be open to exploring whatever tools can best serve the interest and uniqueness of the Guild. The meeting will remain at 4pm UTC weekly on Mondays.


Discussion on Guild Leadership and Rotating Facilitation
Peter broached the discussion of Guild Lead and Facilitation rotation, Ayo acknowledged the vote of confidence from Gorga, who suggested that Ayo should be the Guild Lead.

#### Agenda Items:
- Welcoming new Members and Introduction
- Review of last meeting summary Action Items
- UPDATE STATUS ON DEVELOPMENT TO FILL REPOS! 
- SHOWCASE FINISHED PROPOSAL
- NEW OPERATIONS SYSTEM GOING FORWARD

#### Discussion Points:
- Welcoming of new members: AJ introduced himself to the Guild.
- ACTION ITEMS MEETING: Lordkizzy went through the action items from the previous meeting summary 
- SHOWCASE FINISHED PROPOSAL: We are trying to present deliverables on completed projects to the community. We weren't able to further discuss this because core members of respective projects weren't in attendance. 
- Discussions on "Avoid overlapping between proposals with other Guilds and WorkGroups": We had already had discussions on this in our previous call and Kenichi highlighted the differences in a document (https://docs.google.com/document/d/10v3sUgdtRGkIU_a8K5roGA21-6xNzDLKEkImEiFdZdk/edit?usp=sharing) 
- UPDATE STATUS ON DEVELOPMENT TO FILL REPOS!; Waka refused to give the update status on the Entity connections project that he was working on. Other core members weren't present in the call
- Discussions on "Proposals must not receive funding from Ambassador and DF": Waka expressed that those opinions weren't valid since there hasn't been a case of "double dipping" in the program. Clement highlighted that we should also be trying to prevent something like that from happening in the future and suggested that "if someone is bringing up the level of deep funding, it means there has to be working deliverables that, you know, you have to show for, that it was completed at the level of the ambassadors program. you're going to put up things that you intend to complete, building up from what you've completed, and then try to describe to us the reason for the extra requirements or the extra request for resources." Kenichi indicated that "the whole idea of this is that when you say you want to take a project, we don't know about it from them, definitely they can have their own process. But from the Ambassador Program, especially from the Research Guild, which this is concerned, while any of these projects are individual suggestions and individual proposals, it's still technically for the ambassador program. And in that regard, for the research, you should be the one pushing out the project to do saying, hey, we're building this in our guild, and we believe is a great project and we'd like extra funding. This is coming from the entire guild. Then that will give it much more credibility, which is what we should be looking for. So whenever it's highlighted, okay, where did this project start from, you should be able to say it started from ambassadors. I feel like we need that recognition too. It started from the ambassador program, went to deep funding, got funded, did great stuff."
- Discussions on "Proposals must have a minimum of two people in charge" - There was a suggestion that a team should be decided based on the project complexity. Clement also suggested that if the individual is capable to deliver within the required timeframe then he or she can work on the project alone. Kenichi suggested that we focus more on milestone deliverables, so if an individual has been able to provide milestone deliverables and stops been active, then the guild should communicate with the individual depending on the severity of the project and see if it can be assigned to someone else. We decided to have a poll on it and majority suggested that two people should be a standard going forward.

#### Decision Items:
- We decided that projects could receive funds from both deepfunding and the ambassador program but only under some specific conditions (if the project gets funded first from Deepfunding, then there won't be any need for more funds to be requested but if the project gets funded from the ambassador program and there is need for more funds after presenting deliverables, then the R&D Guild will push the project to DeepFunding)
  - [rationale] the Ambassador program may not provide the funds to completely sustain the development process of the project
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We decided that projects should have a minimum of 2 core members included in the proposals 
  - [rationale] We decided to put this to a vote 
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup

#### Keywords/tags:
- topics covered: Guilds , Budget, Tool Development, Proposal, AI tooling, Budget Request, Budget preparation, contributors, Operations, doubledipping, Deliverbles, Core team, Documentation, Presentation, DeepFunding
- emotions: straightforward, questioning, Casual, lengthy, challenging
- other: Kenichi suggested a process that should be implemented by the Guild: if someone working on a project has been able to provide deliverables and after a while stops work on the project, then the entire project should be on hold and no rewards distributed; but if the project is of high relevance to the guild then the guild should communicate with the individual that proposed the project and suggest going ahead with what they can and what they have. If the individual has any plans of coming back at any point in time and wishes to recontribute to the research and development guild, they will have to finish that project before they are allowed to take up a new one. Unless they claim that they have no interest anymore in the project and at that point in time. then that member shouldn't be given the opportunity to work on another project.

We discusses branding and communication strategies for for the ADN Event. We outlined several future action items to ensure its success. We will develop live interview questions to engage participants and create a dynamic atmosphere. To foster a sense of community, we'll design T-shirts and e-memorabilia for those who win tickets and attend the event wearing them. We plan to put together a round-up by making a recording for those who cannot attend in person, which will be uploaded to the platform. Additionally, we discussed the possibility of live streaming the event to reach a broader audience. Our goal is to have our Instagram and TikTok accounts ready, featuring the same content for both, with Caue appointed as the admin. We also prepared questions for Charles and emphasized the importance of direct onboarding to Telegram, mentioning Deep Funding and the Town Halls Calendar in Portuguese. We divided tasks, considering the number of people we want to join, whether many or few, and the importance of maintaining order, progress, and harmony among participants from various countries and between men and women.


AGI-24 / Topic: AI-Human Collaboration. The nature of AGI in Politics, Social Sustainability, and the Common Good.

In our discussions, we explored the themes of AI, ethics, and creativity for an upcoming roundtable event. We delved into the intersection of AI, creativity, and ethics, considering how these elements influence each other. There was a thoughtful debate on the use of AI in outreach and onboarding guests and participants for the event, weighing its benefits and potential ethical concerns. We emphasized the importance of thorough preparation for events and interviews, including strategies for handling difficult questions. To promote the event effectively, we discussed creating engaging content and developing a content media chronogram to ensure a consistent and compelling promotional campaign.

There will be a poll to decide this.

### Writers Workgroup

- Type of meeting: Weekly
- Present: Kenichi [facilitator], cjfrankie  [documenter], Kenichi, Mikasa, cjfrankie, devon, Emmanuel Issac, Ruti, Nebula, Boluwatife Ajumobi, Nengi
- Purpose: Discussion on the recently concluded Zealy Sprint and writing more drafts for the community page.
- Working Docs:
  - [WWG Scribbler Onboarding Form](https://forms.gle/yLzrMbtUjjhcgWUj9)

#### Narrative:
The meeting started with Kenichi welcoming everyone to the meeting! We kicked things off from the Zealy side of things; thankfully, the Zealy sprint has ended, however, the random winners🏆 haven't been announced yet. Momentarily, Kenichi added that the next sprint should start immediately — July 22nd, to be precise. Kenichi also suggested that we should repeat some quests from last quarter; he also hinted that the last sprint had a low turnout rate and a decline in participation compared to other springs.

Dework update: Cjfrankie and Devon shared updates on the current tasks assigned to them.

Following that, Kenichi called the Scribblers' attention to the community page, and he added that the community page is out of draft. He also encouraged the Scribes to source more drafts. Kenichi added that he would dig into the inventory to source old, unpublished articles pending the time when new drafts will be ready! 

From a bird’s-eye view, July looks like a transformative month for the WWG: we crossed our KPI of 200 followers on the ambassador Medium page, but we're not stopping there! We need more people to engage with our content.

Peer Review: Following a discussion with the Writers' WG test submission, Kenichi still emphasized the need for using suggestion mode to edit drafts so that the writers can see what changes were made. Kenichi also commended Nengi for her test;  momentarily, he announced that Nengi is now officially a Scribbler and that he will get the Scribbler tag for her. He also encouraged the Scribes to keep sharing the WWG Scribbler Onboarding Form since we haven't reached our onboarding number for Q3.

Following the revamped marketing guild, marketing wants to join forces with the writers' workgroup. To this effect, Kenichi proposed a giveaway or airdrop initiative where people with the highest Zealy points get rewarded.
