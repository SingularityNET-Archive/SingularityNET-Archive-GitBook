#### Discussion Points:
- Headelf welcomed everyone and discussed the ACP quizzes system which were supposed to be set up 
- The one good point which was raised was by Duke Peter that whether or not to include repetitive questions in each spinoff projects. He also asked whether the question are going to be open book or not ? because if not then there might be some scenarios for cheating and answering questions by keeping the video and infographics infront of them to answer them.
- HeadElf replied to Duke concerns through an example that having open book exams are not that effective as its kind of a rat chase where people start to cram through everything they find which may or may not be useful and is not a good way to keep information in your mind.
