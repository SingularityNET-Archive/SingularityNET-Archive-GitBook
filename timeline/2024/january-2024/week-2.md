### <mark style="color:green;">Video WorkGroup</mark>

#### Present:&#x20;

Rojo \[facilitator], Judith \[documenter], Lord\_kizzy, Malik, DevonHardy, lilycupcake, Slate, Tuso, cardano\_class, Iamgorgasiagian, Sf4015

#### In this meeting we discussed:&#x20;

The overall purpose of the meeting was to go over the new budget, the new workgroup operations strategy and to assign members to recurring tasks for the next month until they will rotate.

Rojo shared the page on the Ambassador GitBook with the information on all tasks that need to be done on a regular basis in the workgroup. The page outlined what each recurring task is and how that task should be done [https://snet-ambassadors.gitbook.io/home/workgroups/video-workgroup](https://snet-ambassadors.gitbook.io/home/workgroups/video-workgroup)

Rojo shared information on usual tasks eg. ‚ÄòMake a clip‚Äô or ‚ÄòMake a video‚Äô: The criteria and guidelines for those tasks are always outlined in Dework.

Discussed the difference and definition of ‚ÄòMembers‚Äô vs. ‚ÄòSenior Members‚Äô. Members: Should participate in meetings, votes and clip editing. Senior Members: 1 month as a member with at least 20 hours of tasks completed.

Discussed recurring tasks and voted who will be in charge of which task over the next 4 weeks. Recurring tasks were distributed only among members present in the voice channel. For every task, people indicated their interest, then 1 member was selected to assume the role for the next month.

Discussed that recurring tasks will have no description on Dework but a link to Ambassador Gitbook.

Went over the new Video Workgroup Budget Proposal Sheet made by Rojo which outlines the rewards for recurring tasks and video projects [https://snet-ambassadors.gitbook.io/home/workgroups/video-workgroup/structure-and-governance/quartely-budget](https://snet-ambassadors.gitbook.io/home/workgroups/video-workgroup/structure-and-governance/quartely-budget)

Talked about the onboarding process: people interested in joining the video workgroup will be directed towards a task on Dework with several subtasks

#### Decisions:&#x20;

\[decision] Recurring tasks need level of seniority (can only be done by Senior Members)\
\[decision]  For the next months recurring tasks will be done as follows. Task management: Devon Hardy. Weekly meeting facilitation + preparation + documentation: Rojo. Weekly meeting summaries: Judith. Social Media Management: Malik. Town Hall editing: Tuso. Town Hall Summary editing: Lilycupcake\
\[decision] Members are considered people who participate in meetings, votes and clip editing\
\[decision] Senior Members are considered people who have spent 1 month as a member in the workgroup with at least 20 hours of tasks completed

#### Action items

\[action] Will need to figure out permissions for social media soon, maybe on Monday\
\[action] Members to be responsible for their newly selected recurring tasks immediately for the duration of 1 month

#### Keywords:&#x20;

**Topics covered**\
Gitbook, Recurring Tasks, Task Assignment, Senior Member, Roles.
