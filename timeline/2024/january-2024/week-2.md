### Archives Workgroup

- Type of meeting: Biweekly
- Present: Stephen [facilitator], Stephen, Vanessa [documenter], Vanessa, Stephen, André, Peter, lord kizzy, Slate
- Meeting video: [Link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4dGsCqdRj6ct6TwdrVKm_Bjg2ToCjzQh)
- Working Docs:
  - [Meeting issue](https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/80)
  - [Newly-created Issues page in Meeting Summary tool](https://archive-oracle.netlify.app/issues)
  - [Feedback notes for meeting summary tool](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OO1DNL1-4azjeuKLXNwjEnWfGku4nqZeldbiUWLEHkg/edit?usp=sharing)

#### Decision Items:
- André will check the new issues log for the Meeting Summary tool once a week, and will triage them based on the "urgency" label they have been given
  - [rationale] Easiest way to decide which ones to tackle first
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- Meeting issues are not auto-adding to the Issues board - for now, we decided not to fix it, and just do it manually
  - [rationale] It's happening because it's an Organisation project board, not a repo board; and the relevant GitHub action doesn't recognise this - but the obvious fix (to move the Board into the SingularityNET Archive repo) could have knock-on effects that we don't want.
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- We will do a presentation/discussion at a Town Hall on the Meeting Summary tool - date TBC but possibly 23rd Jan
  - [rationale] In future, full updates from each Workgroup will happen monthly, not weekly, so there will be space for "feature" slots on specific topics in the other weeks
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We decided to pay those who have been testing Meeting Summary templates, but still keep the "Bounties" issue open
  - [rationale] Because we plan to set up further bounties to engage new people
  - [opposing] long term this might not be the best way to manage the issue - a bit muddled and confusing - perhaps eventually each bounty needs its own issue
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We noted that we need to submit our Q1 2024 budget as soon as 
  - [rationale] Some WGs have already done so - we are not the last, but we do need to do it sooner than later
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- For "development" work in Q1 2024, André will focus on maintenance and new feratures of the Tool. The other "development" focus will be Ubio's planned initial work with using LLMs for archive searches
  - [rationale] we want the LLM work to be a core focus for the next couple of quarters
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- We agreed to introduce the Meeting Summary tool and process to other areas of the ecosystem 
  - [rationale] We think it's at a point where it might be interesting or useful to e.g. to spinoffs, Supervisory Council, etc, particularly in terms of how it supports good decisionmaking, tracking decisions, and tracking action items
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We decided that our next report, for Q1 2024, will try to link reporting to our actual budget; but it's too fiddly to do it this time
  - [rationale] Because at the moment, the way our issues connect to our budget is still a little muddled at times Ideally, perhaps each issue should link to only one budget line; but at the moment some issues cross over more then one budget item.
  - [opposing] Maybe a quarterly report should be more narrative/descriptive, and simply a way of showcasing what we've achieved in the Quarter.; perhaps tying it to budget should be more of a footnote
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- Actions and decision items from a meeting should appear in the relevant meeting Issue on the board, in the body of the text so it is carried forward to the next meeting.
  - [rationale] Is it poosible for the meeting summary tool to automate this?
  - [opposing] Maybe not a priority, since actions and decisions are recorded via the Tool, but still useful to have them in the meeting issue as well
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- In-depth discussion of contribution models, and why Archives workgroup doesn't track contribution in terms of hours worked, but tasks completed, whereas other WGs track "time spent"
  - [rationale]  Archives WG has always been opposed to tracking contribution as "time spent". We track tasks, not time - the task is what matters, not the time it takes a particular person to do it. Focusing on "time" can distort assessments of contribution, force inappropriate assumptions about work and its value, obscure some types of work (e.g. "micro-engagements" too small to be recorded as "time spent", but which mount up over a month) and overvalue other types (e.g. sitting passively in meetings). Currently, we provide a spreadsheet export of our GitHub Issues Board to track contribution, and we don't use Dework. There may be other ways to add our data to the Treasury system via the metadata of a fund request? But we have a diferent philosophy of what constitutes "contribution" than some other workgroups; and the Dework-based, hourly-rate approach doesn't fit it. Maybe different workgroups should each decide what counts as "contribution" for them; not piecemenal "assessment" but a more overall sense of what someone is contributing
  - [opposing] From discussion at Town Hall yesterday (9th Jan): suggestion that all workgroups should use Gimbals and Dework to track hourly rates, in order to distinguish between new people and long-term contributors for the purpose of assigning decision-making rights. Suggestion that tracking tasks would require more admin overhead than tracking hours
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- Recognition that whatever immediate solution is found to the "contribution" issue, it should be seen as temporary. Suggestion of ongoing conversations (both within and between workgroups) about what "contribution" is, distinction (if any) between contribution and participation, and different ways to value and track contribution.
  - [rationale] Because the issue should remain a live one, we should explore it more, and should try different solutions
  - [opposing] Concern that while this would be good, it shouldn't delay the process of opening up the ambassador role to more people and assessing who is a long term contributor. Suggestion of assigning "Long term contributor" role on the basis of both AGIX *and* Gimbals, so that it cannot be gained simply by attending meetings.
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- Discussion of how/whether we (Ambassador program overall) value expertise, and what kinds of expertise. No decision reached, but suggestion to discuss it further
  - [rationale] Should we reward higher for more prestigious tasks? or more skilled tasks? or for knowledge/capability? other ways to differentiate?
  - [opposing] Or have a flat rate for all tasks?
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople

### <mark style="color:green;">Video WorkGroup</mark>

#### Present:&#x20;

Rojo \[facilitator], Judith \[documenter], Lord\_kizzy, Malik, DevonHardy, lilycupcake, Slate, Tuso, cardano\_class, Iamgorgasiagian, Sf4015

#### In this meeting we discussed:&#x20;

The overall purpose of the meeting was to go over the new budget, the new workgroup operations strategy and to assign members to recurring tasks for the next month until they will rotate.

Rojo shared the page on the Ambassador GitBook with the information on all tasks that need to be done on a regular basis in the workgroup. The page outlined what each recurring task is and how that task should be done [https://snet-ambassadors.gitbook.io/home/workgroups/video-workgroup](https://snet-ambassadors.gitbook.io/home/workgroups/video-workgroup)

Rojo shared information on usual tasks eg. ‘Make a clip’ or ‘Make a video’: The criteria and guidelines for those tasks are always outlined in Dework.

Discussed the difference and definition of ‘Members’ vs. ‘Senior Members’. Members: Should participate in meetings, votes and clip editing. Senior Members: 1 month as a member with at least 20 hours of tasks completed.

Discussed recurring tasks and voted who will be in charge of which task over the next 4 weeks. Recurring tasks were distributed only among members present in the voice channel. For every task, people indicated their interest, then 1 member was selected to assume the role for the next month.

Discussed that recurring tasks will have no description on Dework but a link to Ambassador Gitbook.

Went over the new Video Workgroup Budget Proposal Sheet made by Rojo which outlines the rewards for recurring tasks and video projects [https://snet-ambassadors.gitbook.io/home/workgroups/video-workgroup/structure-and-governance/quartely-budget](https://snet-ambassadors.gitbook.io/home/workgroups/video-workgroup/structure-and-governance/quartely-budget)

Talked about the onboarding process: people interested in joining the video workgroup will be directed towards a task on Dework with several subtasks

#### Decisions:&#x20;

\[decision] Recurring tasks need level of seniority (can only be done by Senior Members)\
\[decision]  For the next months recurring tasks will be done as follows. Task management: Devon Hardy. Weekly meeting facilitation + preparation + documentation: Rojo. Weekly meeting summaries: Judith. Social Media Management: Malik. Town Hall editing: Tuso. Town Hall Summary editing: Lilycupcake\
\[decision] Members are considered people who participate in meetings, votes and clip editing\
\[decision] Senior Members are considered people who have spent 1 month as a member in the workgroup with at least 20 hours of tasks completed

#### Action items

\[action] Will need to figure out permissions for social media soon, maybe on Monday\
\[action] Members to be responsible for their newly selected recurring tasks immediately for the duration of 1 month

#### Keywords:&#x20;

**Topics covered**\
Gitbook, Recurring Tasks, Task Assignment, Senior Member, Roles.
