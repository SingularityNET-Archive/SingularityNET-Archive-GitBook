#### Discussion Points:
- Policy Ratification? The current ratification process is slow as we are not getting a lot of responses
- Discussions on the expected quorum which is 10% of core contributors (i.e. 5.6 people)

- Policy did not reach the Threshold
- We weighed the reactions gotten from last time, and figured out if discord reactions count
Do we accept Discord Reactions too? First version had 6 reactions
- Should people share reason for No and abstain reaction for the policy ratification?
What if there is no reason for Yes consent?

#### Decision Items:
- We agreed to use and accept discord reactions in the consent ratification process of a policy
  - [**opposing**] None
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We agreed that a reaction has to have a comment when it's an objection and if the consent is yes without any comment, we assume the consenter agrees with the policy hypothesis
- If the reaction is Abstain, then they also have to add a comment
- When adding a policy to GitBook, we agreed to add link to the Discord thread IF rule is accepted
