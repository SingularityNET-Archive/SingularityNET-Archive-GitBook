#### Narrative:
Tasks on Github

We started by going through tasks “in progress”;
-We went through feedback from the Admins (Co-chair and mentee by Vani & Colleen, WG async support by LadyTempestt, GEI reportbacks by Jenn and the WG internal management by Sucre) on Github where Sucre suggested that we pick 2 or 3 skilled documentors for our meetings to rotate by Q4 and that meeting summaries need to be completed before the end of the week so they can be closed out. These issues will be closed next week and Vani will create a fresh one against quarter 4 if we get funded.

-Event in Nigeria: Duke gave an update on the event holding in Nigeria in collaboration with African Guild this week; he said they are currently publicizing the event, everything is going as planned and it will take place this weekend(on Saturday). He said that he will share the virtual link for those who will watch online. Vani added that by next week we should be able to get a report back from Duke on how everything went.
Moderation of the AI Ethics forum: The admin team will take a look at what is the best way forward for payment before the next meeting.

-Leeloo gave an update on payments for the AGI-24 pre-conference and the main conference contributors said that GEI is still working on how to make it seamless through the ambassador program or GEI directly instead of using the foundation’s suggestion of an invoice since some people involved might not be allowed to use that payment method. She added that Esther would reach out to Vani concerning the people who can send invoices for their payment.

-Documenting GEI Open Office: Jenn is doing them in batches and will get the second one in by Wednesday this week.

We went onto tasks in “to-do”;
-We talked about paying people who came to the training session for interviews now that the token price is good. 

-Q4 budget: We got one objection( the objector said they were not clear on what exactly our WG does or our main objectives) but it is not really a strong one since we have made this clear in our reports and WG description so every core contributor was requested to go approve our proposal if they think we should get funding. We also discussed a few items on the budget.

-Concerning the Q3 interviews, the task has been transferred to personal issues for everyone involved and every assigned person is expected to move their issue on GitHub to “in progress” once they begin the process and add comments on how the interview went I.e hours spent, reference number, any thoughts on what can be changed and improved. Clement is the first interviewer who got the task done, he said that he followed the steps gotten from the interviews’ training and it made everything seamless. Ese asked if interviewers are to formulate questions for the interview themselves and Vani said that there were not any definite rigid questions but there are general principles about what kind of questions one needs to focus on in the slides Interview training AI Ethics WG from the interviews training session and if she or anyone is unsure, they could post their questions to seek advice in the private channels for Interviewers.

-Q4 Interviews: We asked anyone up for it to jump in and put in their name although the budget for it will be dependent on what we get for funding next quarter. Duke and Vasu expressed interest in it. We will be clear about the budget next week.

-AI Ethics conversations: This issue on Github will remain under “to-do” for a while since we have done that already during the AGI-24 Pre-conference and the chill-out rooms during the main conference although it might be revisited when we come to look at our budget for Q1 2025. 

-AI Ethics WG: Money questions 
If a person does a task badly, should we pay them? And who decides what is bad? Is there an issue about capability when assigning tasks? Does the WG have the capacity to mentor people? Colleen suggested an Ad-hoc decision cos it's subjective and a voting system. Love asked how do we rate “How badly a task is?” PG suggested having expectations for a task established in advance, and measuring what people do against guidelines. Leeloo suggested a rotation of self-elected reviewers. Ese asked “How do we judge “badly”? Sometimes task execution style varies per organization. She made an example by saying that what she might view as bad might be different from what Vani sees as bad. Vani pointed out that PG’s suggestion above might sort that out and that if a task is so bad that it has to be done again then that becomes a problem. Leeloo suggested that maybe just seeing things as either incomplete(didn't do the task) and partial complete (did the task but missing needed material?) might work.

-Vani and Love also shared a belief that If someone does not know how to do a task, they should not step up. They could also ask for mentorship - but this is ONLY if the WG has the time and money to do that; LeeLoo agreed by adding that we will always make out time to train people when necessary like we did for interviewers so they should come for it if they are interested and that if there is no time for such training then WG members should evaluate their skills and make sure they are not putting themselves up for something they can not do. Vani also added that there are going to be times when the WG won't have the time or money to offer mentorship.
On the topic of subjective; Vani pointed out that just because something is subjective it doesn't mean that we can not decide on it and that so many things we think are objective are not.

-We also discussed some guidelines(what is expected from the interviews) and possible issues that could come up with payment for WG members doing interviews this quarter and the next. The guidelines are in this sheet AI Ethics Workgroup stuff!  and have been posted in the private channels for interviewers.



#### Decision Items:
- We agreed to use the stated guidelines for the interviews this quarter and the next.
  - [**rationale**] This was to clarify what we expect from the interviews assigned to some WG members
  - [**effect**] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- We agreed that having expectations on a task in advance is a great idea.
  - [**effect**] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- We agreed to meet again next week so as not to mess up the current calendar.
  - [**effect**] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- We agreed to have as many interviews done by October 14.
  - [**effect**] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup

#### Action Items:
- [**action**] Vani to get in touch with Jenn so she can add a document with an update on GEI reportbacks for 10th September. [**assignee**] Vanessa [**due**] 30 September 2024 [**status**] todo
- [**action**] Vani will reach out to Clement and agree on how much moderating the AI Ethics forum really costs after meeting with the admin team. [**assignee**] Vanessa [**due**] 30 September 2024 [**status**] todo
- [**action**] Vani to create individual issues for people involved in tasks during AGI-24 pre-conference and the chill-out rooms during the main conference. [**assignee**] Vanessa [**due**] 30 September 2024 [**status**] todo
- [**action**] Vani to pin the link to the consent forms for the interviews in the AI Ethics WG channels. [**assignee**] Vanessa [**due**] 30 September 2024 [**status**] todo
- [**action**] Duke is to post the link to watch the AI Event in collaboration with the African Guild online in the AI Ethics WG channel. [**assignee**] Duke Peter [**due**] 30 September 2024 [**status**] done

### Onboarding Workgroup

- **Type of meeting:** Weekly
- **Present:** CollyPride [**facilitator**], CallyFromAuron [**documenter**], LadyTempestt, CallyFromAuron, SucrenSpice, kateri, Clement Umoh, lord kizzy, Tuso., CollyPride, TheFreysDeFi, PeterE, Duke
- **Purpose:** Weekly meeting discussing how to onboard people to the Ambassador program
- **Working Docs:**
  - [Skillshare Matrix Doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12R9WMWZRBQDRnnHUFC3dVoZwRkgKgNfj7uLBSaBNqkg/edit?usp=sharing)
  - [Q4 Budget proposal](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1x9Rwdujw6BnYHtqx5TAeoEo1HK4N2OyJUguDH2hNHwQ/edit?usp=sharing)
  - [Onboarding WG Objection Summary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dfpDaS8rNmsDbHAZipDG3XQ5BEfMmlRblq_328jbOhM/edit?usp=sharing)

#### In this meeting we discussed:
- Business:
- We gave the standard reminder for new people to add their skills to the skillshare matrix
- We agreed the minutes of the last meeting
- We checked action items from the last meeting
- We checked facilitation and documentation next meeting
- Town Hall Updates - we confirmed that Tuso delivered them on the 24th as planned
- Onboarding Journeys
- Q4 Budget
- Github Project Management Training
- Gorga’s apology

#### Decision Items:
- Facilitation next meeting: We reassigned Jenn's facilitation role to LadyTempestt


  - [**rationale**] because Jenn has not been around much lately; and because she was not present today, so missed the chance to be mentored as a facilitator.
  - [**effect**] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- We approved the graphics for the Onboarding Journeys. We decided we will propose a session to share them with the rest of the community on Thurs Oct 10th, at the Open Gov session. This will be led by Duke and ideally Onize as the writer of the scripts, if she is free; with CJFrankie supporting if he's able to be there.
  - [**rationale**] We agreed some time ago that we want to share the journeys with the wider community in an Open Gov call - looking at the infographics and discussing the barriers we identified and how the community might work to overcome them.
  - [**opposing**] none, although CJFrankie is unsure whether he'll be free to attend.
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- Budget - we noted that Onboarding WG has passed the consent process, with no objections. However, as budget fitting of around 20% will still be needed, we agreed:
1) we will move to meeting fortnightly (this will save approx $450 in itself, plus another $350-ish on Dework and Miro work)
2) we may move part of the research project on "onboarding to decentralisation" to Q1 2025
3) we may decide to lose or reduce the budget line for contribution to documents
4) the Focus Group will meet to finalise these issues and will bring a proposal for a fitted budget to the next meeting on 3rd Oct.
  - [**rationale**] Because the lowering percentage is likely to be around 21%, so we will need to lose around $1,200 from our budget
  - [**opposing**] no objections, but some concerns raised about postponing the research project any further, since it has already been postponed from Q3 to Q4
  - [**effect**] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- GitHub Training session was confirmed for Mon 7th Oct, and is on the Calendar already. There have been some small changes made to the publicity for the session; and the title has been changed from  "GitHub Project Management" to "Project Board Demo".
Also a Zoom link has been added to the publicity blurb that will be posted.
  - [**rationale**] Marketing had inflated it to something more extensive than it will actually be (it's not a complete guide to project management), so it has been toned down a bit to avoid giving a false impression.

- In last week's meeting on Gorga’s allegations against the WG, Gorga agreed to apologise in writing in the WG Discord channel channel, after which we will give our agreed response in writing (i.e. that if he makes any further unfounded allegations, he will be suspended from the WG for a period and will be ineligible for paid tasks). Gorga has not done this yet. We agreed that we would still like him to do so; but that if he does not do so by next week, we will still issue our agreed response in writing

  - [**rationale**] For clarity and transparency.

## Friday 27th September 2024


### Writers Workgroup

- **Type of meeting:** Weekly
- **Present:** Kenichi [**facilitator**], Cjfrankie  [**documenter**], Kenichi, cjfrankie, LadyTempestt, Gorga Siagian, Emmanuel Issac, Ines, Mikasa, AJ
- **Purpose:** Weekly meeting of the writers' workgroup, centered on the Q4 proposed budget.
- **Working Docs:**
  - [WWG Q1 Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jvQ4DfJd6WYsYdZORg8t4g3Dsft88guYno7bxWIMsVQ/edit)

#### Narrative:
Kenichi started the meeting as he normally would; he welcomed everyone, and then he highlighted the meeting agenda. 
He started by asking the scribes if the published drafts on the community page had been edited. Cjfrankie answered that Gorga submitted his draft a few hours before the meeting, so the review will be done over the weekend. Kenichi also urged Ines to submit the Overcoming Nursing Challenge document to the community page. Moving forward, he shed light on the MIX POST social media tool; he hinted that Video WG is already using it and it’s time for the WWG to explore the tool. A lot of conversations happened in the Zoom Chat — Ines Gavina, Lady Tempestt, and Gorga took to the chat to talk about exploring more social platforms like Reddit, Quora, and LinkedIn, to expand our reach as a community. Gorga also showed interest in writing an article about the token event in Singapore featuring Jasmine from Rejuve.

Budget Update: We tackled the budget discussion together. Following a discussion in the OpenGov call on 26th September, it is clear that our budget only needs a slight edit to have it pass. According to the Treasury, we only have to make a 20% cut, and to this effect, we glanced through the budget sheet to see the areas we can adjust. Additionally, Kenichi mentioned that moving forward, we will be focusing more on ecosystem-related articles and Twitter threads while the community page takes a break since we have published quite some articles over the last couple of months. Kenichi talked about reducing Zealy allocation, and how WWG and Video WG are joining forces toward making Zealy a success. To keep Zealy fully functional, Video WG will send some allocation while we keep running Zealy three times in a quarter. Ines suggested that we take our Spanish page management from the WWG budget and have it led by the LatAm guild. Interestingly, we have reallocation funding coming into the WWG account; however, Kenichi is still in close contact with Tevo, and he will share more detailed information as we move further along. Kenichi stated that due to the low token price, Zealy is on hold till further notice and the Friday trivia game will become biweekly.



#### Decision Items:
- We decided that the Zealy allocation will come from both the WWG and the Video WG to save cost, and we’re also looking forward to moving it to the marketing guild.


  - [**effect**] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- We decided to change the Friday trivia game from weekly to biweekly, due to budget constraints.
  - [**rationale**] Due to the token price and budget fitting, we might not be able to fund the trivia if it keeps running on a weekly basis. Rather, a bi-weekly schedule will save us some money.

- Slate began by noting that the Gamers' Guild budget was approved in the initial iterations, highlighting that the quarterly report was well-prepared and met everyone's expectations. He congratulated all the members of the guild.
- Next, workgroup updates were presented, and Kateri showcased the Archives Workgroup model. It featured an impressive design that conveyed the ambiance of a library. Suggestions included enhancing the detailing and slightly increasing the length of the upper floor.
- CollyPride presented the R&D Guild model, which required significant revisions as it resembled the Video Workgroup's building. Slate agreed to help help the creators in revamping it.
- Photogee presented the Dework PBL Workgroup model, which featured an attractive design with a helipad on top. Inside, there were images of Dework displayed on the walls. Slate suggested arranging the pictures more orderly and recommended adding additional elements related to Dework PBL. He noted that the colors and textures should reflect the Dework aesthetic, but overall, it was a commendable model.
- Martin presented the Treasury Guild, starting with an exterior view of the building, which featured "Treasury Guild" prominently displayed along with a dollar sign above. Inside, there was a depiction of the treasury dashboard and a counter where members were conducting transactions. A vault, guarded by security personnel, was also included, along with a newly added treasury meeting room. Suggestions were made for improvements, indicating that many additional elements could enhance the building.
- Finally, Malik showcased the Education Guild building, which featured impressive interior design and a futuristic aesthetic, including a hologram representing a digital twin. The walls displayed infographics and NFTs. The main suggestion was to reduce the building's size, to which Malik responded that the Education Guild has many upcoming projects, and that space could be utilized to represent them.
- Slate then announced the workgroup creators who will assist him in developing the VR map. The two modelers are Gorga and Kateri who created the Archives Workgroup. He also mentioned that he will soon select two additional workgroup creators as the quarter begins, noting that everyone now understands how to build on Roblox.
