# Week 37

## Saturday 14th September 2024

### Gamers Guild

- Type of meeting: Biweekly
- Present: Slate [facilitator], devon [documenter], Gorga Siagian, hotasiro, martinsoki, malik, CollyPride, SubZero, scarecrow, hufiumer69, rebel, Tevo
- Purpose: The meeting centered around a demonstration of various models and tools in Roblox. Participants showcased their progress, discussed improvements, and explored the use of specific plugins to enhance their designs.
#### Discussion Points:
- Slate outlined the meeting agenda
- Slate started the meeting by demonstrating the use of a plugin called Scene Tools on Roblox. He highlighted how this plugin could be used to create spinning objects for decoration. By showing how a part could be made to rotate upon its axis, Slate emphasized the ease of using Scene Tools to make workgroups in Roblox appear more dynamic. He further demonstrated how to add an image (such as an NFT) to the part and how to scale and position the image label. However, Slate encountered a minor issue when using GIFs, which the plugin couldn’t load properly. He showed how the part, when decorated with infographics and light rays, could create an eye-catching element in a virtual workspace.
- Rebel shared his work on the building model of the Dework PBL Workgroup. He had made changes from the previous iteration, including adding a second floor and designing various functional spaces such as an entrance, meeting room, and classroom. Rebel highlighted the use of teleporters for navigation between floors, using a proximity prompt for interaction. He also demonstrated the design of a computer lab, aquarium, and other virtual elements. There was a brief discussion about an overlay message on the screen that needed to be removed, but overall, Rebel received positive feedback for his design.
- Malik presented his model of the Education Guild workgroup. Malik explained the various sections he had built, including an entry section with an NPC to welcome users, a meeting schedule board, and a digital twin representation based on the Twin Protocol. He also created an ideation room, initially meant for an AI project, but later adjusted to serve as a space for brainstorming and initiatives like the AI for Beginners project. Malik had also included infographics, but ran into some challenges with implementing rotating elements, for which Slate had offered earlier assistance. The Education Guild Building got finalized.
- Scarecrow showcased his Treasury Guild model, which was designed to resemble a bank, fitting the theme of treasury management. He walked through the design of a parking lot, meeting areas, a cash counter, and a security vault. Scarecrow used NPCs to represent key members of the guild, with each NPC placed strategically in the model to depict the work they do within the guild. He also discussed future plans for expanding the model, possibly to the second floor.
- Lord Kizzy provided input regarding the Treasury Guild workgroup, discussing the structure of two sub-workgroups: Treasury Automation and Treasury Policy. He suggested these could be housed on different floors, but was unsure about the logistics due to the lack of documentation and the newness of the groups. He explained that while the Treasury Automation group was a temporary project, the Treasury Policy group would likely be more permanent. This led to a discussion on how best to accommodate these within Scarecrow’s existing model.
- Colleen joined towards the end of the meeting and provided an update on the R&D Guild workgroup. She mentioned that she had not been able to get a response from her partner OEP, but was willing to continue development. Slate suggested that Gorga (their mentor) could assist Colleen in moving the project forward.
- Slate demonstrated another useful plugin called Archimedes. This plugin is used to create circular arrangements of parts, which is typically difficult to achieve in Roblox. Slate walked through how to spawn parts and use the plugin to form perfect circles, which could be useful in a variety of design contexts. He also mentioned another plugin, 3D Text, which could be used to create 3D labels for workgroups, adding a professional touch to virtual environments
- Slate introduced the design of the VR map for the game, featuring three layers: a city, a river with a bridge, and Ambassador University. Players start in the city, where they earn AGIX currency by completing tasks, before moving to the university to finish quests and gain admission. The map development will utilize six baseplates and will require two best modelers to assist Slate with development of the city, river, and university sections. Players can explore all areas freely, but passes can be bought for faster progression. Slate also mentioned the potential to create portals linking different games or spin-off projects after players complete the Ambassador program.

#### Decision Items:
- Malik to remove a joke in the dialogue box from his workgroup.
  - [rationale] It had not been well-received by some members.
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- Rebel needs to resolve an issue with an overlay message that appears on top of his workgroup model in Roblox.
  - [rationale] It felt like a watermark.
- the Treasury Automation and Treasury Policy groups would be part of the Treasury Guild model, but the exact placement (whether on one floor or two) would be determined based on further exploration by Scarecrow.
  - [rationale] These two groups are permanent according to Tevo and linked to the treasury system.
