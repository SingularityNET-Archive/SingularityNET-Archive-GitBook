#### Narrative:
INTRODUCTION - The purpose of this meeting is to discuss the draft Strategy Guild Q3 Report and Q4 Budget proposal


ACTION ITEMS CHECKBOXES FROM THE LAST MEETING -  Ayo led this. Items DONE were closed and others were left OPEN:

1. Continue contribution to the Guild’s working document [OPEN]

2. Gorga to create a poll in Discord for other people to vote on the preferred meeting schedule for the guild [DONE]

3. Effiom to draft and share last meeting summary [DONE]

4. Yemi to follow up with other Gs/WGs representatives who are yet to fill out the form [DONE]

5. Continue working on the Strategy Guild Q3 Report and Q4 Budget proposal async [DONE]

6. Adopt Last Meeting Notes - 02.09.2024 [DONE]



ONBOARD NEW MEMBERS/CORE MEMBER ROLL CALL - Since the last meeting, Photogee met all the core membership requirements but no new person indicated interest in the document.

Ayo advised those who have indicated interest in becoming members of the Guild but are yet to meet all the requirements, to ensure to update their records as they meet the pending requirements.



GORGA ALLEGATIONS ON PARTICIPATION OPPORTUNITIES IN THE GUILD - Gorga highlighted his concerns which were mostly about the Q4 budget:
* The Q4 budget doesn’t completely explain how tasks will be carried out

* Q3 wasn’t transparent citing the example of the availability of the meeting notes which were meant to be made available in Discord before the meeting but are only shared in the meetings

* Hopes that in Q4 other members will get to prepare meeting agendas, facilitate meetings, and also create meeting notes

Ayo responded to these claims, citing that:

* The Guild restarted its operations in Q3, and just like other Guilds in which Gorga is a member, he got to contribute in the following quarter and not the first quarter he joined

* Members who were contributing majorly were those that understood the Q3 budget and were present during the approval process, hence it was easier for them to take part in the activities this quarter

* He stated that members were asked to indicate facilitation interest in the working doc, and a roster was being worked on ahead of Q4 using that list

* Gorga contributed to the research and was rewarded as a representative of the WWG during the Q3 workshop



THE DRAFT Q3 REPORT AND Q4 BUDGET DISCUSSIONS - The Guild’s meeting has been updated to capture the new Bi-weekly schedule. The workshop initiative will continue based on the success of the Q3 workshop. 


A.O.B - Ayo expressed gratitude to the participants and provided an overview of the plan for the next sessions.

#### In this meeting we discussed:
- Agreeing the minutes of the last meeting. 
- Skillshare matrix.
- Action items from the last meeting.
- Facilitation and documentation next time.
- Onboarding Journeys. 
- Q4 Budget Draft. 
- Workgroup Closure: We talked about having a threshold or cap for the number of new people we can onboard into the workgroup.
- Contributors to edit documents in Q4.
- Gorga’s Allegations.


#### Decision Items:
- WG Closure: We already have enough contributors in the WG, and the proposed budget for Q4 2024 wouldn’t cover more WG activities to give tasks for new people; plus, there is a concern that the total Ambassador program budget for Q4 is high, so significant budget-fitting will be needed. In light of such, we have decided to temporarily close the WG and consider re-opening at the end of Q1 2025. 

  - [**effect**] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- We agreed that for the budget-line on document editing, two people will be assigned to edit each document we create in Q4. We will aim to select one person who has done similar work before (e.g. report writing), and use the Skillshare Matrix to select another individual who has shown interest in working with the topic of the document.

  - [**effect**] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- We decided that Colleen will lead the “GitHub Project Management Training" session on Mon 7th October 2024 by 13:00 UTC.

  - [**effect**] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup

#### Keywords/tags:
- **topics covered:** Skillshare Matrix, onboarding journeys, Q4 2024 budget, q3 2024 budget fitting, budget fitting, Workgroup closure, Contributors to edit docs, Gorga’s allegations

#### Narrative:
NOTE: this is a detailed summary, because those present were keen for all the ideas and insights to be documented so we don’t lose them.

We noted that due to the recent AGIX price rise, the lowering percentage for budget fitting will be a little less than anticipated, but still high, at around 28%.

No prior items on the agenda, so Peter opened it to the floor.

Sucre n Spice raised the question of problems with the current budget process (unreasonably high requests leading to a difficult budget-fitting process; etc). In the past we used agreed percentage allocations to each WG (see spreadsheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h6yTQGvkNhp-88a3wRCTxpKTpC24d4kIOWj1mpWrmxU/edit?usp=sharing  for details) and WGs simply had to work within their agreed allocation - would it work better to return to this?
If we did, the arguments would be about what percentage each WG should have, rather than about budget totals - but at least there is a constraint (it has to add up to 100%), whereas the current process has none, and WGs are expanding their budget requests ad lib. 
She noted that the current process was always intended as an experiment, so we can change it.

Points raised:
- We could shift to AGIX-based allocations rather than USD (Peter) Might make things easier, as it's the coin we work with (Kevin); but people think in fiat, not AGIX, so it's less intuitive. Also, budgeting in AGIX shifts the burden of token price fluctuation onto the WG or individual, not the Program overall, which feels unfair. (Vani)

- Or, fixed prices for tasks, as in DeepFunding, where it's either $10 or $20 depending on the task. (Peter)  But that takes away WG autonomy - a WG should be free to pay more for a task, e.g. documentation, if they choose. WGs can spend their allocation as they see fit, then give a quarterly report so others can check if they think the WG used the money well. (Vani)

- Have tiers for the percentage allocations? because some WGs are cheaper than others to run. (Vani)  But the WGs who have historically requested and got higher budgets would end up in a higher tier, regardless of how justified their high budget was (Peter). And what would be the criteria for allocating a WG's percentage? If some WGs historically have asked for more budget, do we question / examine that? And do we assess their outputs, rather than just basing it on an average of what they have requested in previous Quarters? (Clement)

- Have a pot for WGs to use if they go over their budget but they're doing good work (Kevin)

- When AGIX price was higher, WGs got very ambitious - but now price is lower, WGs should  recognise that they can only afford basic operational costs plus one or two projects. Or, if they want to continue doing the same work,  they have to pay less for tasks. (Sucre)

- Let’s decide which of these suggested changes are "safe to try", and try them out, rather than just talking about them. The current budget process isn't working, in that it takes up too much of our time. (Love)

- First step should be a retrospective of the whole of this budget process, over several Quarters, and analyse how it has affected the way workgroups operate. Then collate all the ideas for alternatives, so we can properly discuss them  (Vani)


- We might need to merge some WGs; and we need to stop proliferating new ones. We now have 21 WGs; each of them adds budget overhead. (Sucre). We should have due process for starting a WG - we can’t afford unlimited WGs.  (LadyTempestt). Merge WGs, especially ones that are just subgroups of the same guild; and /or reassess whether we even need some groups, in terms of their outputs or in terms of our overall direction for 2025. What we need will change over time - some WGs might need to end to allow others to start (Duke).

- Be careful about consolidating WGs, because decentralisation. Each WG has its own character; let’s not force people to consolidate with others who might be superficially similar, but are approaching it in different ways and learning from each others’ different approaches (Vani)

- We should be more output-driven: e.g. end-of-quarter meetings where WG leads explain and justify their budgets (Duke)

- The *number* of WGs might be a red herring - as long as they’re low-budget, and temporary, it might be OK. (Vani) But in practice, workgroups don’t end once they’ve done a job. So probably, a WG once started is here to stay (Sucre)

- Budget caps? rather than the current “ask for any amount, and then do budget-fitting”? Because currently some WGs barely reduce their ask in response to lower token price, and nothing is said. Caps could tame this, and could be determined based on outputs, and/ or the Program’s overall priorities. (Duke)

- What do we value and want to fund? The discussion could get poisonous if we’re not careful, but maybe we need to discuss it. There are divergent opinions and no right answer; percentage allocations would mean different WGs can do what they value, without a lengthy process of everyone having to approve every detail of others’ work. (Vani)

- Split it into “operational” budget and “project” budget? All WGs get the same for the operational costs of running a group, but different amounts for projects (Sucre). “Project” allocation could be based on an average of what the WG has spent over the last 4 Quarters; and it would be what the Program can afford to give, not whatever the WG asks for. The WG will then do what it can with what it’s given (LadyTempestt), Some WGs spend a lot on tasks that are not really important to the Program. Can they be honest enough to cut those tasks? Or do we need to help them recognise it, via a consent process? (Sucre). 

- “Operational cost” and “project cost” might not work for some WGs. For those who produce content, it’s all “operational”. So tiers, based on average budgets in the past, would be best. There are already de facto “tiers” in place - some WGs have had consistently high spends and others consistently much lower (LordKizzy).

- There might be problems with averaging out the last few Quarters. Firstly, some WGs didn’t exist then; also, some WGs did more project work and requested more budget when token price was higher, but cut back when it was lower, whereas others haven’t cut back. And finally, some WGs overpriced certain tasks when token price was high, just to use more budget.

- The last time a percentage allocation system was used, there were broad tiers (LordKizzy). But today, we have different needs, and different WGs might be in the “top” tier - so we need to assess it based on what we’re now focused on, not just on what a WG got in the past. I’m not sure how far back we should go (Colleen).
I feel token price is the crux of the issue. If AGIX was at $1, we wouldn’t even be having this conversation. So if we get a tier system in place and then token price rises, would we revert to the current system? And should we start submitting budgets in AGIX? (Clement). In Onboarding WG, although we submit our budget in dollars, we work it out based on an assumed exchange rate (Sucre). If we did all calculate our budgets in AGIX, we would know what we have, whether token price goes up or down (LordKizzy)

To be discussed next meeting, on Tues 17th. (Love).



#### Discussion Points:
- Problems with current budget process - should we move to a percentage allocation? or some other approach? 
- Holding a retrospective not just on this Quarter's budget process, but on our current budget process as a whole, across several Quarters, to assess how well it is working.
- Proliferation of workgroups - no more new workgroups, especially when they are subgroups of the same Guild? Or a better-defined process for starting WGs? And/or assessing WGs' outputs, to see if we need that WG 
- How to decide what we value and want to fund. Can we all agree which WGs to have, based on the Program's overall aims? or are there too many differences of opinion on what is needed to achieve the Program's aims?
- Do we need to assess WG outputs more formally in order to determine budgets?
- "Operational" vs "project" budgets?
- Budget tiers, and budget caps? or not?
- Should we budget in AGIX or USD?

#### Decision Items:
- We agreed to hold a retrospective about the entire budget process over several quarters

### Gamers Guild

- Type of meeting: Biweekly
- Present: Slate [facilitator], devon [documenter], Gorga Siagian, hotasiro, martinsoki, malik, CollyPride, SubZero, scarecrow, hufiumer69, rebel, Tevo
- Purpose: The meeting centered around a demonstration of various models and tools in Roblox. Participants showcased their progress, discussed improvements, and explored the use of specific plugins to enhance their designs.
#### Discussion Points:
- Slate outlined the meeting agenda
- Slate started the meeting by demonstrating the use of a plugin called Scene Tools on Roblox. He highlighted how this plugin could be used to create spinning objects for decoration. By showing how a part could be made to rotate upon its axis, Slate emphasized the ease of using Scene Tools to make workgroups in Roblox appear more dynamic. He further demonstrated how to add an image (such as an NFT) to the part and how to scale and position the image label. However, Slate encountered a minor issue when using GIFs, which the plugin couldn’t load properly. He showed how the part, when decorated with infographics and light rays, could create an eye-catching element in a virtual workspace.
- Rebel shared his work on the building model of the Dework PBL Workgroup. He had made changes from the previous iteration, including adding a second floor and designing various functional spaces such as an entrance, meeting room, and classroom. Rebel highlighted the use of teleporters for navigation between floors, using a proximity prompt for interaction. He also demonstrated the design of a computer lab, aquarium, and other virtual elements. There was a brief discussion about an overlay message on the screen that needed to be removed, but overall, Rebel received positive feedback for his design.
- Malik presented his model of the Education Guild workgroup. Malik explained the various sections he had built, including an entry section with an NPC to welcome users, a meeting schedule board, and a digital twin representation based on the Twin Protocol. He also created an ideation room, initially meant for an AI project, but later adjusted to serve as a space for brainstorming and initiatives like the AI for Beginners project. Malik had also included infographics, but ran into some challenges with implementing rotating elements, for which Slate had offered earlier assistance. The Education Guild Building got finalized.
- Scarecrow showcased his Treasury Guild model, which was designed to resemble a bank, fitting the theme of treasury management. He walked through the design of a parking lot, meeting areas, a cash counter, and a security vault. Scarecrow used NPCs to represent key members of the guild, with each NPC placed strategically in the model to depict the work they do within the guild. He also discussed future plans for expanding the model, possibly to the second floor.
- Lord Kizzy provided input regarding the Treasury Guild workgroup, discussing the structure of two sub-workgroups: Treasury Automation and Treasury Policy. He suggested these could be housed on different floors, but was unsure about the logistics due to the lack of documentation and the newness of the groups. He explained that while the Treasury Automation group was a temporary project, the Treasury Policy group would likely be more permanent. This led to a discussion on how best to accommodate these within Scarecrow’s existing model.
- Colleen joined towards the end of the meeting and provided an update on the R&D Guild workgroup. She mentioned that she had not been able to get a response from her partner OEP, but was willing to continue development. Slate suggested that Gorga (their mentor) could assist Colleen in moving the project forward.
- Slate demonstrated another useful plugin called Archimedes. This plugin is used to create circular arrangements of parts, which is typically difficult to achieve in Roblox. Slate walked through how to spawn parts and use the plugin to form perfect circles, which could be useful in a variety of design contexts. He also mentioned another plugin, 3D Text, which could be used to create 3D labels for workgroups, adding a professional touch to virtual environments
- Slate introduced the design of the VR map for the game, featuring three layers: a city, a river with a bridge, and Ambassador University. Players start in the city, where they earn AGIX currency by completing tasks, before moving to the university to finish quests and gain admission. The map development will utilize six baseplates and will require two best modelers to assist Slate with development of the city, river, and university sections. Players can explore all areas freely, but passes can be bought for faster progression. Slate also mentioned the potential to create portals linking different games or spin-off projects after players complete the Ambassador program.

#### Decision Items:
- Malik to remove a joke in the dialogue box from his workgroup.
  - [rationale] It had not been well-received by some members.
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- Rebel needs to resolve an issue with an overlay message that appears on top of his workgroup model in Roblox.
  - [rationale] It felt like a watermark.
- the Treasury Automation and Treasury Policy groups would be part of the Treasury Guild model, but the exact placement (whether on one floor or two) would be determined based on further exploration by Scarecrow.
  - [rationale] These two groups are permanent according to Tevo and linked to the treasury system.
