#### Narrative:
The meeting worked through "in progress" tasks on the Board, and then "to do".

"In Progress":
We worked through the Admin team's tasks.

We noted that Colleen's work as "co-chair mentee" has focused more on community engagement than learning about the co-chair role itself - but this is a positive, since she has created a role that the WG needed. We agreed therefore to add this as a role in the Q4 budget.

Vani noted that in future, where it's useful to do so, we can distribute the WG's connection with the GEI - it shouldn't necessarily only be via the co-chair role. (For example, Duke wll be in touch with Esther and LeeLoo as speakers for the AI Ethics Expo in Nigeria).

Vani noted the usefulness and importance of the "async work support" role, given the kind of work we are doing.

We noted that we still don't know the cost of Clement's Q3 role of moderating the AI Ethics forum https://github.com/SingularityNet-Ambassador-Program/AI-Ethics-Workgroup/issues/32 - Clement will suggest a price based on how the Moderator WG costs things. He will also add the same amount to the budget for Q4.

We will create individual GitHub Issues for people's work at AGI-24, as it now looks as if the Foundation will be able to pay the work via the normal Ambassador process.

The Admin team has looked at the interviewing projects that people proposed for Q3, and have brought them within budget; so these will go ahead, ideally by the end of Q3 (although if it goes a little over, that is OK). We note that we have a really good range of people being interviewed. Any interviews that had to be cut can be re-proposed in Q4, as there will be more budget for interviews then. 

The training for interview skills will now be 1 session not 2, and will be run by Vani and Peegee. Date: Wednesday, September 11th, 12:00 UTC, lasting 2 hours. It will be recorded for anyone who cannot make it, but Peegee explained how we'd like people to attend live if they can, as it will be participatory. It's open to all - but especially we'd like those who are doing Q3 interviewing to attend.


To Do:
We discussed reallocating the Q3 budget line for further work on the Strategies, because it has turned out that all the work that's needed can be covered by Vani's role as co-chair, and by Esther's input.

The AI Ethics Expo event in Nigeria (collab with African Guild) has a date: Sat 28th September. The planning element of our budget contribution has been done (venue and publicity) and the other elements (speakers and volunteers) will be paid after the event. Duke is liaising directly with LeeLoo and Esther as speakers from the GEI side.  

Vasu suggested that he could do some Q4 interviewing at an AI event in Dubai on 11th and 12th December, which he will be attending. Vani encouraged him to note it in the WG's Q4 interview planning spreadsheet (in the "AI Ethics Stuff!" doc).

Q4 budget:
 - We discussed reducing meeting frequency to monthly, but there was significant enough oppositon to decide against it.

- We discussed the budget line for Jenn's reportbacks to GEI - are they useful? Does GEI want them? We discussed this, but did not reach a conclusion. LeeLoo suggested that we might need the reports more once interviewing is in progress; possibly they are also good for transparency.

- We agreed on budgeting for 40 interview hours this Quarter; conducting a small amount of work to share the GEI survey; and creating some educational resources.

- We noted that comments and revisions to the budget need to be made by Fri 6th Sept, to allow for final editing before the submission deadline on September 9th. 


#### Decision Items:
- Vani's Q2 task to monitor the strategy-drafting work and maintain the strategic approach of the WG https://github.com/SingularityNet-Ambassador-Program/AI-Ethics-Workgroup/issues/3 was closed.
  - [rationale] Because the task is complete for Q2. We noted that the strategy drafts that were written were broader in scope than needed, but this shows that it was a learning exercise, and people were engaging with it.
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- for Jenn's "GEI reportbacks" task https://github.com/SingularityNet-Ambassador-Program/AI-Ethics-Workgroup/issues/20, there were no GEI meetings in August; we agreed this shouldn't affect Jenn's pay.
  - [rationale] Because the cancellations were beyond her control.
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- We agreed to add a new role for community engagement in the Q4 budget, to be taken by Colleen
  - [rationale] because Colleen's work as co-chair mentee in this quarter has taken her in this direction, and it seems to be a role that is needed
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- We agreed to reallocate the Q3 budget line for further work on the Strategies, and use it to compensate those doing Q3 interviewing to attend the Interview Skills training, as this training will cover how the strategies are going to be practically implemented. Priority would go to those who are assigned to do interviews in Q3; anyone else is fisrt-come, first-served.
  - [rationale] Because the further work this quarter on the strategies has been started by Esther and Vani, and the meetings we budgeted for are not really needed any longer
  - [opposing] We note that this was a budget element we were going to cut completely when token price was low - so using it this way will depend on token price.
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- We agreed that the current admin workers will stay in their roles, except that Colleen will move to a new community engagement role, and there will be budget for a new Co-Chair Mentee in Q4.
  - [rationale] because continuity is needed at the moment, and to avoid too much mentoring/handover overhead 
  - [opposing] There was a suggestion that those in admin roles should not have first refusal on other tasks.
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- After discussion, some people felt uncomfortable with the suggestion of  moving to monthly meetings; so we will continue to budget for fortnightly meetings in Q4
  - [rationale] Some members were uncomfortable with the  suggestion of monthly meetings, and argued that fortnightly meetings will enable new people more opportunities to engage and contribute; and that monthly meetings can make it harder for new people to learn how things work in the Program overall.
  - [opposing] The suggestion to move to monthly was to minimise unnecessary costs - partly because the particular work we do doesn't require meetings, but works better in small groups - especially in the coming Quarter, when we will be focused on interviewing; and partly because we are unlikely to have many tasks to invite new people to, so having extra meetings to engage new people might raise false expectations. 
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup

#### Agenda item 1 - Ambassador Account Permissions - [resolved]

#### Discussion Points:
- How many and which tools are tied to the Ambassador account?

- Who decides, and how do we decide, account permission changes?
- How do we update Ambassador account permissions?
- What is the quorum required to grant a person access?

#### Decision Items:
- The headers for the google sheet for requesting access were agreed on
  - [rationale] This was decided based on the relevant information the person requesting needs to provide, like Discord name, position, tools they use (Zoom, Google Drive etc), comments, is the account accessible etc.
  - [opposing] None
- We agreed to keep the process simple, hence no need for quorum
  - [rationale] Deciding on a quorum can be a stretch and would definitely make the process longer
  - [opposing] None
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- There should be a degree of anonymity in the decision-making process, in case people have reservations about the people requesting access. Hence, the feedback form should be created under Swarm account.
  - [rationale] It is expected that whoever is requesting is a Core Contributor and might have access to view the feedback. For these reasons, there is a need for anonymity and to achieve this the form would be created from an account outside SNET
  - [opposing] None
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- Permission Granted (in 3 working days)
  - [rationale] This number of days is ideal for the process
  - [opposing] None

#### Agenda item 2 - Coordinate Treasury Guild Q3 Report and Q4 Proposal - [carry over]

#### Discussion Points:
- How best to capture the deliverables of the quarter in the report, since it will be shared before end of Q3?
- Do we update the report later, at the end of the quarter? 
- Planning ahead for budget fitting; the preferred approach

#### Decision Items:
- In quarterly reports we highlight things that are not yet completed
  - [rationale] Because the quarterly is being prepared before the end of the quarter
  - [opposing] None
- Adjust dates in Q4 Report to include the Q3 final date and Q4 Report creation date
  - [rationale] It would better represent the reporting cycle, as quarterly reports are usually prepared before the end of the quarter
  - [opposing] None
- In Q4 report we have a section to address Q3 proposal deliverables that was not completed in Q3 report
  - [rationale] This would allow us to capture all our deliverables accurately
  - [opposing] None
-  We reduce the number of Treasury Guild meetings when we get budget fitting
  - [rationale] It made sense to adjust the meeting schedule to accommodate budget fitting
  - [opposing] None
- Propose to create a tool to calculate Core Contributor List that provide different outputs for updating and sharing public lists under Treasury Automation WG
  - [rationale] This is an automation and since Automation WG is getting a different budget from Treasury Guild, It made sense to move it
  - [opposing] None

- Tokens with tickers (INF)
- Should we include label to represent Decision Making?

#### Decision Items:
- We don't include MINS as it is hard to assess
  - [rationale] Hard to assess and overhead to request or track

  - [Knowledge Base WG Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Lb9DwNSzmToyMhl5qZG9QEFipH9ZmlnDNaVU1jYeqFc/edit?usp=sharing)

#### Agenda item 1 - Open Questions - Why do we not do more async organizing? - [resolved]

#### Discussion Points:
- Currently, we have run out of funds
- We should refocus on planning, reporting and proposals to continue our work effectively
- Use LLM first to organize the items before we start with team
- Lets have an onboarding kick-off session so that we can reach and involve more people into organising Ambassador assets.

#### Agenda item 2 - Open Questions - What LLM experiments is Knowledge Base WG doing? - [carry over]

#### Discussion Points:
- we have a working ChatGPT Prototype
- Currently we have ideas to improve it even further
- What other LLM experiments Knowledge Base could do?

#### Agenda item 3 - New participation-based rewarding model for Knowledge Base WG - [carry over]

#### Discussion Points:
- What is the Rewarding Model? This is a new model to reward people who attend our meetings and participate in discussions.
- Do we want to change the current facilitation mechanism to participation reward distribution based on contributions?
- The current model does not consider how long a person was in the meeting and applies rewards equally regardless if they were in the call 10 minutes or 100 minutes.
- Do you think we should differentiate that?
- When should we apply reward changes weight based on how long the person was in the meeting?

#### Decision Items:
- Most people leaned towards including weighting the individual rewards before calculating participation rewards. Except Onyeka and AdvanceAmeyaw who suggested after.

- Process Guild Q3 Proposal

#### Decision Items:
- We moved around some items such as average attendance metrics, deliverables, etc.
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup

#### Agenda item 5 - Q4 Knowledge Base WG Proposal - [carry over]

#### Discussion Points:
- Should the Q4 proposal include a ChatGPT yearly subscription for use in async organization work?
- Is a separate Gitbook from the Ambassador Gitbook a good idea?

#### Decision Items:
- We agreed to include it in the Process Guild Q4 budget. It's a useful tool, and we will use that if we get funded with the proposal.
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- Knowledge Base WG will have its own GitBook instead of focusing on introducing items to Ambassador GitBook. The sentiment here is that this will allow the Process guild to automate and be consistent with their structure of adding information and storing assets.

- Meeting video: [Link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4dGsCqdRj6ct6TwdrVKm_Bjg2ToCjzQh)
- Working Docs:
  - [SNET Archive AI features (draft of possible features an AI tool might have)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LROsgVAQ9fQbNgMRK5qMI8q8KYsN-rGI-Gq9lvXAN5w/edit?usp=sharing)

  - [New Summary Tool Features](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wxziaDEdMdYeiqv0ecuuygHgfd9a9F18odje_2qaT7g/edit?usp=sharing)
  - [Meeting issue ](https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/198)
  - [draft Q3 quarterly report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZJeuLJ_5GYUjxZiUUEfXHkMfDTJoH11wjLmsTU-K3n0/edit?usp=sharing)

#### Decision Items:
- Summary tool redesign: See issue https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/181 - André and Vanessa to meet to discuss priorities
  - [rationale] Because want to focus initially on things that will have the biggest effect on ease of use of the tool
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- PDF export function in the Summary tool is broken again - André has decided to replace it with export to Google Doc
  - [rationale] This is a feature that people have requested too - it makes it easier to share a draft meeting summary with other memebers of your WG and get their comments. This will also obviate the need for more complex tooling to allow people to comment within the tool itself, which was a suggested new feature at one point.
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We went through the Q4 budget, and were sad to acknowledge that a lot of the work we would like to do, we cannot afford, so it has had to be cancelled for the coming Quarter.
  - [rationale] due to token price drop in August, we had to move some core work to Q4, leaving not enough for routine but less valuable tasks
  - [opposing] some people felt understandably unhappy that their tasks have had to be cut.
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- We also acknowledged in the Q3 quarterly report (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZJeuLJ_5GYUjxZiUUEfXHkMfDTJoH11wjLmsTU-K3n0/edit?usp=sharing) the problems raised by an increasing uncritical reliance on Read.ai summaries. We noted that the problem is that superficially, Read.ai summaries can seem fine; and it is only when one reads with attention and with some knowledge of the Program that it becomes clear that they do not make any sense. We suggested that documentation for WGs such as Treasury and Governance, which are about the Program as a whole rather then the internal activities of a WG, should no longer be seen as an entry-level task, since they require considerable understanding of the program to document well.
  - [rationale] This has been a big issue this quarter, and has slowed down the meeting summary process since many summaries have needed to be extensively corrected or redone.
  - [opposing] We recognised that it is ironic that we are an AI ecosystem and yet one of our stumbling-blocks is an AI tool - but we noted that the problem is people trying to use Read.ai's documentation *uncritically*, or without skilled and knowledgeable human intervention. We also noted that it may actually be an *ethical* issue to understand the limitations of any AI tool, and not to expect it to work beyond its limitations.
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We noted how many corrections core members of this WG are needing to make to summaries at the moment; and that there is a need for ongoing training for new documenters. Onboarding WG recently (15th August) delivered some training on documentation; perhaps other WGs can take this on within their own WG to some extent.
  - [rationale] Training is needed not only to learn how to document a meeting, but also to understand the limitations of Read.ai summaries, and the ethical issues raised by using AI tools.
- We agreed that anyone who does need to do extensive corrections to a summary should add their name to the "Documenter" field alongside that of the original documenter
  - [rationale] as a way of noting that correction has been done
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We agreed that we need to find ways to raise the issues around read.ai summaries, perhaps in a WG Sync call. Suggestion that perhaps we need a Reviewers' Circle to review summaries; or a Documenters' circle to avoid poor summaries in the first place
  - [rationale] Because over-reliance on Read.ai is an issue that affects the documentation of several WGs, and perhaps could be addressed at Program level
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople

#### Narrative:
Should people who subbed for Peter E as facilitator for Town Hall during his absence (PhotoGee, Guillermo and Ese) be paid via Gov WG budget? We agreed yes. And how much? We agreed on $20. Vani will add tasks to Dework.

Guillermo has created a timeline infographic RE: budget submission deadlines. He and Vani will proofread it after this meeting, then start sending it out. Meanwhile, Ese has been sharing the infographic reminding WGs of budget submission date.

Finalising Governance WG's own Q3 report and Q4 budget: Guillermo has drafted the budget, and shared it in the Governance Discord channel a few days ago. So far, no comments. We set a final deadline for comments/edits of Sat 7th Sept;  but essentially, we signed it off. Clement has drafted the quarterly report - same arrangement, we basically signed it off in this meeting, but final comments or changes are possible until the end of Sat 7th.

Q4 consent process: when to calculate new Core Contributors list and run the opt-in process? It needs to be done by Monday 9th, as the consent process begins then. We agreed for Tevo to do it (and he noted that he is aiming to automate it for next time). We also noted that being a Core Contributor is supposed to be an "opt-in" thing - so someone, probably Peter, will need to ping people and invite them to opt in. We noted that doing this on Monday is cutting things fine in terms of the timeline, but there is no alternative for now.
 
Vani had created a draft initial consent form (i.e. just a list of all the WGs and "consent/object/abstain") a while ago and posted in Governance Discord channel. (The purpose of having this initial form, with no rationales required, is to make it quicker and simpler for people to participate in a first round, and "weed out" the WGs whose budgets everyone consents to - last quarter this was around half of all WGs - so that the next round only focuses on the groups for which there are objections.) We tweaked the introduction to the form, which was too long, and might be offputting for people. The form now needs to be moved to the Ambassador Gmail account before it is sent out.

We discussed how far the consent forms are really anonymous (see "decisions" below)

We discusssed what "Abstain" means, particularly in the final consent round, when WGs need to get at least 80% consent. (see "decisions" below)

We re-discussed and confirmed what will happen if budgets are submitted late i.e. after deadline of Mon 9th Sept. (see "decisions" below); although we did not finalise the exact process for how the "small operational budget" will be decided on; we agreed to discuss it later if it actually happens.  Tevo suggested that those who do not want to make the effort to submit a budget request by the deadline probably do not need funds, but the "new ideas" budget of 2% can be accessed by anyone who really needs money.

We discussed whether we want to move to a different decision-making method, other than the consent process we are currently using. We noted that Consent was only ever adopted as an experiment, so we can change; and we noted that the consent process has become quite consuming, with most of Governance WG's time being given over to it. We mentioned alternatives including Consensus; weighted voting; sortative or aleatory processes (such as a jury);  Consultative; or creating collective funding proposals rather than individual WG proposals. Objections were raised to voting as a process, because it doesn't give room for discussions, reasons, objections, and doesn't work to increase community engagement. There was interest in Consensus and Consultative processes; and some comments in favour of continuing to explore Consent processes because it encourages listening, ideas, and iterating, despite problems with having too many iterations in the process. It was also mentioned that R&D guild plan to build a dashboard to make the consent process run smoother.

We briefly revisited the discussion on "Increasing participant numbers, with a non-increasing programme budget" which has been covered several times. We felt it may still need discussing again - and particularly, the question of whether we should be training people, or just giving tasks to those who already know how, and looking at capability. We noted that the issue was initially raised when token price had recently dropped dramatically; but now it has recovered a bit, do we see things differently?


#### Decision Items:
- Facilitating Town Hall in Peter's absence will be paid from Governance WG budget; and at a rate of $20
  - [**rationale**] There isn't any other WG that it could reasonably come from; Governance will probably have enough budget to cover it; and the content of recent Town Halls has been quite Governance-related. The pay rate is the same as facilitating a Governance WG meeting.
  - [**effect**] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- We agreed and signed off the Q3 quarterly report and Q4 budget for Governance WG, although we will still leave them open for any last-minute changes until the end of Saturday 7th Sept
  - [**rationale**] They have been open for comments for a while and there have been none - and we don't want to be making changes on the submission date of Monday 9th itself.
  - [**effect**] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- We decided to make the intro text to the initial consent form shorter
  - [**rationale**] Partly for accessibility, as long blocks of text can be offputting; but also because some of the information is repated in the Context-setting doc.
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We agreed that the intro text of the consent form should not say that the forms are "anonymous", but rather, "private"
  - [**rationale**] because they are not entirely anonymous - people's identity can be seen by anyone who has access to the Ambassador Program Gmail account.
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We noted that an abstention doesn't count either as a consent or an objection for the purpose of the final consent round, when WGs need to get 80% consent 
  - [**rationale**] "abstain" is just a way of checking how many Core Contributors are aware of the consent process and participating in it, even if they do not have time ("abstain" might sometimes mean "I didn't have time to read this WG's budget").
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We confirmed that, as agreed in our meeting last Tuesday, if a WG's budget is late, we will go ahead with the idea that the WG will be withdrawn from the consent process, and will get a small operational budget based on their operational costs over the last couple of Quarters; the amount to be worked out collaboratively with them.
  - [**rationale**] This has been an ongoing problem and everyone has been informed about it numerous times
  - [**opposing**] One objection was raised to this idea when we posted it in the Ambassador General Discord chennel - but it didn't fully explain its reasons and there was no suggestion on a way forward, or what to do instead; and when Vani responded and asked for this, the objector didn't make things any clearer; so overall the meeting felt that it wasn't valid an we can't hold up the process for it.
  - [**effect**] mayAffectOtherPeople

#### Action Items:
- [**action**] Vani to add Town Hall facilitation tasks to Dework (facilitators were Photogee, Guillermo and Ese) [**assignee**] CallyFromAuron [**due**] 12 September 2024 [**status**] todo
- [**action**] All to check Gov WG budget and quarterly report, and make any final amendments [**assignee**] all [**due**] 7 September 2024 [**status**] todo
- [**action**] Tevo to re-calculate who is Core Contributor, ideally by tomorrow (Friday 6th Sept), but definitely by Monday 9th; and Peter to ping all of them and check that they want to be one. [**assignee**] Tevo [**due**] 6 September 2024 [**status**] todo
- [**action**] Tevo to send out the initial consent form (once it has been moved to the Ambassadors' Gmail account) on Monday [**assignee**] Tevo [**due**] 9 September 2024 [**status**] todo

### Writers Workgroup

- **Type of meeting:** Weekly
- **Present:** Kenichi [**facilitator**], Cjfrankie  [**documenter**], Kenichi, Mikasa, cjfrankie, LadyTempestt, devon, Gorga Siagian, Advanceameyaw, Nebula, King David, Emmanuel Isaac, Nengi, Inesgav
- **Purpose:** Weekly meeting of the writers' workgroup, focused on the Q4 budget discussion.
- **Working Docs:**
  - [DRAFT: WWG Q3 Report ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cqzXDc73Fx1eZdQlEA8lj9YBag-h6Zj9Si9bI18hQLY/edit)
  - [DRAFT: Budget Proposals Sheet: Q4 Writers Workgroup ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LDOqqcp3bQFgQFdzn2hgZsBl47WMBX0HJ4_DJzOVyIw/edit)

#### Narrative:
The meeting started with Kenichi welcoming everyone, and then he highlighted the meeting agenda; we ticked off the action items for the last meeting, and the meeting kicked off properly.

Momentarily, with screen sharing, we began to tackle the Q4 budget draft. Although there is a significant decrease in the amount, WG members (Lady Tempestt and Devon) shared their concerns and thoughts on some of the deliverables. The meeting featured a discussion on Gorga’s initiative, which aims to expand the reach of SingularityNET in Indonesia through X (formerly Twitter). Many were of the opinion that we should implement the idea in Q1 2025 given the fact that AGIX is dropping and with a concern about the Q4 allocation not being able to sustain the WG. Following that, Lady Tempestt suggested that Kenichi give Gorga a KPI tracking matrix for the proposed initiative. Inés supported Gorga’s idea, and she suggested that the French X page could be suspended to give Gorga a chance. As a matter of finality, Kenichi added that the French page could still be functional regardless; he also said that we could still go forward with the Indonesian page as it might perform better than we expected.

Kenichi spoke about the August points system allocation, highlighting that the payout was pretty low due to the AGIX price decline.

Kenichi also talked about the “We Are Reading" Series by Inés. He expresses his love for the previously published series. He added that he’d glance through Inés’s latest submission while having Mikasa make a thread for it.



#### Decision Items:
- Due to the AGIX token decline, we have decided that the WWG onboarding window will be closed after September 2024 until further notice.

  - [**rationale**] We wouldn't like the fact of having people around without engaging them with tasks.
  - [**effect**] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- One of our biggest visions of the WWG is to begin a podcast series; however, we have decided to push the idea to the marketing guild, and we’re looking forward to having 4 episodes in Q4.

  - [**rationale**] Everybody agreed because the WWG Q4 budget won't be able to handle the podcast.
  - [**effect**] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- Following a discussion on AGIX token price, Kenichi decided that the SingularityNET ecosystem page should get more attention moving forward to keep readers engaged. Following that, he also pointed out that some tasks will be uploaded on Dework without any reward until Q4 kicks in.
  - [**rationale**] Since the community page has more interactions, we should focus on the ecosystem page moving forward so the page won't be left out.

#### Action Items:
- [**action**] Kenichi to give Eve the Scribbler tag. [**assignee**] Kenichi [**due**] 13 September 2024 [**status**] done

#### Keywords/tags:
