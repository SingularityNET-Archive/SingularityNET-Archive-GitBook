  - [Knowledge Base WG Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Lb9DwNSzmToyMhl5qZG9QEFipH9ZmlnDNaVU1jYeqFc/edit?usp=sharing)

#### Agenda item 1 - Open Questions - Why do we not do more async organizing? - [resolved]

#### Discussion Points:
- Currently, we have run out of funds
- We should refocus on planning, reporting and proposals to continue our work effectively
- Use LLM first to organize the items before we start with team
- Lets have an onboarding kick-off session so that we can reach and involve more people into organising Ambassador assets.

#### Agenda item 2 - Open Questions - What LLM experiments is Knowledge Base WG doing? - [carry over]

#### Discussion Points:
- we have a working ChatGPT Prototype
- Currently we have ideas to improve it even further
- What other LLM experiments Knowledge Base could do?

#### Agenda item 3 - New participation-based rewarding model for Knowledge Base WG - [carry over]

#### Discussion Points:
- What is the Rewarding Model? This is a new model to reward people who attend our meetings and participate in discussions.
- Do we want to change the current facilitation mechanism to participation reward distribution based on contributions?
- The current model does not consider how long a person was in the meeting and applies rewards equally regardless if they were in the call 10 minutes or 100 minutes.
- Do you think we should differentiate that?
- When should we apply reward changes weight based on how long the person was in the meeting?

#### Decision Items:
- Most people leaned towards including weighting the individual rewards before calculating participation rewards. Except Onyeka and AdvanceAmeyaw who suggested after.

#### Action Items:
- [action] Participation is captured using the Process Guild service to import from Zoom [assignee] Tevo [due] 18 September 2024 [status] todo
- [action] Review the results of the next and last session this quarter [assignee] all [due] 18 September 2024 [status] todo

#### Agenda item 4 - Review Q2 & Q3 Proposal Report - [carry over]

#### Discussion Points:
- We went through the Quarterly reports while Tevo listed tasks/deliverables and other items carried out so far under the Knowledge Base Section.
- The main aim of Process Guild which is to maintain open spaces and support Knowledge Base WG and Dework PBL WG.
- Process Guild Q2 Proposal
- Process Guild Q3 Proposal

#### Decision Items:
- We moved around some items such as average attendance metrics, deliverables, etc.
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup

#### Agenda item 5 - Q4 Knowledge Base WG Proposal - [carry over]

#### Discussion Points:
- Should the Q4 proposal include a ChatGPT yearly subscription for use in async organization work?
- Is a separate Gitbook from the Ambassador Gitbook a good idea?

#### Decision Items:
- We agreed to include it in the Process Guild Q4 budget. It's a useful tool, and we will use that if we get funded with the proposal.
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- Knowledge Base WG will have its own GitBook instead of focusing on introducing items to Ambassador GitBook. The sentiment here is that this will allow the Process guild to automate and be consistent with their structure of adding information and storing assets.

- Working Docs:
  - [SNET Archive AI features (draft of possible features an AI tool might have)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LROsgVAQ9fQbNgMRK5qMI8q8KYsN-rGI-Gq9lvXAN5w/edit?usp=sharing)

  - [draft Q3 quarterly report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZJeuLJ_5GYUjxZiUUEfXHkMfDTJoH11wjLmsTU-K3n0/edit?usp=sharing)

#### Decision Items:
- Summary tool redesign: See issue https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/181 - André and Vanessa to meet to discuss priorities
  - [rationale] Because want to focus initially on things that will have the biggest effect on ease of use of the tool
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- PDF export function in the Summary tool is broken again - André has decided to replace it with export to Google Doc
  - [rationale] This is a feature that people have requested too - it makes it easier to share a draft meeting summary with other memebers of your WG and get their comments. This will also obviate the need for more complex tooling to allow people to comment within the tool itself, which was a suggested new feature at one point.
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We went through the Q4 budget, and were sad to acknowledge that a lot of the work we would like to do, we cannot afford, so it has had to be cancelled for the coming Quarter.
  - [rationale] due to token price drop in August, we had to move some core work to Q4, leaving not enough for routine but less valuable tasks
  - [opposing] some people felt understandably unhappy that their tasks have had to be cut.
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- We also acknowledged in the Q3 quarterly report (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZJeuLJ_5GYUjxZiUUEfXHkMfDTJoH11wjLmsTU-K3n0/edit?usp=sharing) the problems raised by an increasing uncritical reliance on Read.ai summaries. We noted that the problem is that superficially, Read.ai summaries can seem fine; and it is only when one reads with attention and with some knowledge of the Program that it becomes clear that they do not make any sense. We suggested that documentation for WGs such as Treasury and Governance, which are about the Program as a whole rather then the internal activities of a WG, should no longer be seen as an entry-level task, since they require considerable understanding of the program to document well.
  - [rationale] This has been a big issue this quarter, and has slowed down the meeting summary process since many summaries have needed to be extensively corrected or redone.
  - [opposing] We recognised that it is ironic that we are an AI ecosystem and yet one of our stumbling-blocks is an AI tool - but we noted that the problem is people trying to use Read.ai's documentation *uncritically*, or without skilled and knowledgeable human intervention. We also noted that it may actually be an *ethical* issue to understand the limitations of any AI tool, and not to expect it to work beyond its limitations.
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We noted how many corrections core members of this WG are needing to make to summaries at the moment; and that there is a need for ongoing training for new documenters. Onboarding WG recently (15th August) delivered some training on documentation; perhaps other WGs can take this on within their own WG to some extent.
  - [rationale] Training is needed not only to learn how to document a meeting, but also to understand the limitations of Read.ai summaries, and the ethical issues raised by using AI tools.
- We agreed that anyone who does need to do extensive corrections to a summary should add their name to the "Documenter" field alongside that of the original documenter
  - [rationale] as a way of noting that correction has been done
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We agreed that we need to find ways to raise the issues around read.ai summaries, perhaps in a WG Sync call. Suggestion that perhaps we need a Reviewers' Circle to review summaries; or a Documenters' circle to avoid poor summaries in the first place
  - [rationale] Because over-reliance on Read.ai is an issue that affects the documentation of several WGs, and perhaps could be addressed at Program level
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
