#### Agenda item 1 - Open Questions - Why do we not do more async organizing? - [resolved]

#### Discussion Points:
- Currently, we have run out of funds
- We should refocus on planning, reporting and proposals to continue our work effectively
- Use LLM first to organize the items before we start with team
- Lets have an onboarding kick-off session so that we can reach and involve more people into organising Ambassador assets.

#### Agenda item 2 - Open Questions - What LLM experiments is Knowledge Base WG doing? - [carry over]

#### Discussion Points:
- we have a working ChatGPT Prototype
- Currently we have ideas to improve it even further
- What other LLM experiments Knowledge Base could do?

#### Agenda item 3 - New participation-based rewarding model for Knowledge Base WG - [carry over]

#### Discussion Points:
- What is the Rewarding Model? This is a new model to reward people who attend our meetings and participate in discussions.
- Do we want to change the current facilitation mechanism to participation reward distribution based on contributions?
- The current model does not consider how long a person was in the meeting and applies rewards equally regardless if they were in the call 10 minutes or 100 minutes.
- Do you think we should differentiate that?
- When should we apply reward changes weight based on how long the person was in the meeting?

#### Decision Items:
- Most people leaned towards including weighting the individual rewards before calculating participation rewards. Except Onyeka and AdvanceAmeyaw who suggested after.

#### Agenda item 4 - Review Q2 & Q3 Proposal Report - [carry over]

#### Discussion Points:
- We went through the Quarterly reports while Tevo listed tasks/deliverables and other items carried out so far under the Knowledge Base Section.
- The main aim of Process Guild which is to maintain open spaces and support Knowledge Base WG and Dework PBL WG.
- Process Guild Q2 Proposal
- Process Guild Q3 Proposal

#### Decision Items:
- We moved around some items such as average attendance metrics, deliverables, etc.
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup

#### Agenda item 5 - Q4 Knowledge Base WG Proposal - [carry over]

#### Discussion Points:
- Should the Q4 proposal include a ChatGPT yearly subscription for use in async organization work?
- Is a separate Gitbook from the Ambassador Gitbook a good idea?

#### Decision Items:
- We agreed to include it in the Process Guild Q4 budget. It's a useful tool, and we will use that if we get funded with the proposal.
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- Knowledge Base WG will have its own GitBook instead of focusing on introducing items to Ambassador GitBook. The sentiment here is that this will allow the Process guild to automate and be consistent with their structure of adding information and storing assets.
