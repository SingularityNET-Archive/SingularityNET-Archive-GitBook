  - [Today's meeting Issue ](https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/202)

#### Decision Items:
- Summary tool redesign: See issue https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/181 - André and Vanessa met on Mon 9th Sept and agreed priorities (see New Summary Tool features https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wxziaDEdMdYeiqv0ecuuygHgfd9a9F18odje_2qaT7g/edit?usp=sharing) and have decided to focus initially on the quicker fixes that will make most difference for documenters.

Some changes have already been made: the interface is more mobile-friendly; there is export to Google doc rather than PDF; fields are now blocks with all the text visible at once, rather than single lines that you need to scroll up and down to see; fields such as who is present, tags, tc can be cleared with one click; and there is a "light" mode (there will be a "dark" mode reinstated for those who prefer it!)
  - [rationale] Focusing on these changes first, because want to focus initially on things that will have the biggest effect on ease of use of the tool. 
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We decided that the "Open source paradigm" work would be best presented at a Town Hall rather than a separate meeting. Stephen to pick a date in October and let Peter know.
  - [rationale] Because in TH in the past, conversations about open-source have been lively - clearly those who attend find it an interesting topic.
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- We agreed that some of the insights in the "How to make a document community owned" (see https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hQs4ocUhT6mrvgn-ZjTO7O2aVDm-KEsYIiPaAOQH1Gc/edit?usp=sharing) could be folded into Stephen's presentation on our open-source paradigm
  - [rationale] because the issues raised relate to open-source ethos and culture
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople
- On the open source docs management work: André has discovered a way to record a reuseable auth token for Google docs 
  - [rationale] so he does not have to change the API key every week
  - [effect] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup
- On our tag taxonomy: this is close to finished, and a controlled vocab will likely be incorporated into the summary tool redesign; we will have an option for "other", so that people can add new tags, but they will not be immediately visible in the Tool - any new tags added will be ratified in Archives meetings.
  - [rationale] To avoid problems with people adding tags that are really similar to existing tags.
  - [effect] mayAffectOtherPeople

## Friday 20th September 2024

### Writers Workgroup

- **Type of meeting:** Weekly
- **Present:** Kenichi [**facilitator**], Cjfrankie  [**documenter**], Kenichi, cjfrankie, LadyTempestt, Gorga Siagian, Emmanuel Isaac, AJ, Evelyn Robert, Eric Davies
- **Purpose:** Weekly meeting of the writers' workgroup.
- **Working Docs:**
  - [WWG Q1 Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jvQ4DfJd6WYsYdZORg8t4g3Dsft88guYno7bxWIMsVQ/edit)

#### Narrative:
Kenichi welcomed everyone to the meeting. Cjfrankie pointed out that he had completed the Q4 proposed draft for the Substack newsletter. Kenichi began to share his screen, and we glanced through Cjfrankie’s draft, and he shared more clarity and possible ways we could improve it.

Secondly, Kenichi added that he’d be doing some research to find some articles for the board; he mentioned that this article would mark the completion of our Q3 KPI of 45 publications. Momentarily, he mentioned that the Zealy is 7 days away from completion; he then urged the scribblers to give their suggestions and ideas towards Zealy.

We also had a conversation about the Friday trivia game. It is very clear that the same set of people are always winning; it’s okay if they’re playing the game fairly! Kenichi shared his vision of purchasing a paid version of the Quizcord bot, which allows for private trivia; we could also check for people who aren’t playing the game fairly. By doing this, people won’t lose interest in the trivia.

Lastly, we went over the Q4 budget concerns that were raised by the objectors. Some of the concerns were that the budget was too high. We talked about how budget reduction could slow down processes in the WG. From the Zealy and Twitter side of things, we’ve been able to achieve some remarkable feats. Some of the core elements in the WG still run on a free plan, e.g. Zealy, which limits the WG’s workspace and gives us no access to analytics.



#### Decision Items:
- Following a discussion on the Quizcord bot, we have decided to try out the bot by getting a paid plan, which goes for $9 per quarter.
  - [**effect**] affectsOnlyThisWorkgroup

#### Action Items:
- [**action**] Cjfrankie to chase Gorga and Ines to add their drafts to the community page. [**assignee**] Cjfrankie  [**due**] 27 September 2024 [**status**] done
- [**action**] Kenichi to chase AJ and Kareem concerning their test documents and have them sent to the scribes for peer review.
 [**assignee**] Kenichi [**due**] 27 September 2024 [**status**] done
- [**action**] Kenichi to add some tasks to the board after conducting his research! [**assignee**] Kenichi [**due**] 27 September 2024 [**status**] done

#### Keywords/tags:
- **topics covered:** Quizcord bot, Peer-review, Zealy, Twitter, Triva, Q4 2024 budget, Q2 2024 KPI
- **emotions:** insightful, Discursive, speedy, calm
