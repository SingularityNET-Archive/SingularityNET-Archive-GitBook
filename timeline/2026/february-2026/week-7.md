#### Narrative:
#### GitHub board
Our Github board has been tweaked to fit with Treasury's requirements, so payments can now be processed directly from it without needing to use Dework.

Anyone with a task in progress should move their task to "done" when it's finished. From there, WG admins will check and move it to "Audited", which is where Treasury takes their list of payments from.


#### Q1 2026 Transcription tasks
Some have been completed already; others still in progress.
Vani also has a backlog of transcript checking tasks - as the pay is so low, she cannot make it a priority at the moment, but will aim to complete some in the next couple of weeks.
We checked with task assignees present in the meeting, and there are no particular blockers
Completion date is Fri 27th Feb; any tasks not moved to "done" by then, Love will chase them, and if not completed, they will be reassigned to anyone who has time and interest.


#### Interview coding session
Successfully took plzace on Fri 30th January, and was quite well-attended (we publicised it in DeepFunding and BGI Nexus too) 
Recording is here https://youtu.be/FGSpaK_YmTw?si=WdOUZvZuw1e0BVxY


#### Writing up research conclusions 

As agreed last meeting, we plan to pay 3 or 4 WG members to review the transcripts and coding from our interview material, and use these plus their own experiences of interviewing and transcribing to suggest themes or topics for articles, which will be written up by Esther or Vani. 

Token price has fallen again since January, so we note that as we have only 500 AGIX budgeted for this, people would be taking part on an almost volunteer basis. However, maybe we can a) give some writing-skills mentorship, and b) people would be named as co-authors on anything that is published, which might be of value to some people.

Lola, Love and Ashley expressed interest - we will also ask in Discord in case anyone not present in today's meeting is interested.

Vani will discuss with Esther at their check-in session next week, to see if we *can* offer mentorship. She will also copy all the anonymised material we have into one folder, so interested people can have a look.


#### AI and ecology / suatainability discussion session
A reminder that this meeting will take place on Weds 18th Feb at 16:00 UTC




#### Decision Items:
- As of now, payments will be proicessed directly from the GitHub board
  - [**rationale**] because Dework is no longer being maintained, and because Treasury is now able to integrate GitHub Boards with the Treasury system

- We will invite interested WG members to suggest possible themes for articles about our research. To this end, we will copya ll our anonymised interview material into one place, so that people can look at it all with a view to suggesting topics for articles.
  - [**rationale**] at the moment for privacy reasons it's all distributed around several folders on the BGI Nexus drive
