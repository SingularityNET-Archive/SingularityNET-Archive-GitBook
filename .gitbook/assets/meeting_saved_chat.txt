	 Thats what I am wondering. Some of the responses here feel like this is not a debatable topic and that we can't change the parameter. I agree mistakes can be made and that's ok

21:56:58 From  cran dano  to  Everyone:
	my take is proposers are interacting with the platform and if there's experimentation being done to reward interaction I don't see why they would be left out of the rewards - this just incentivizes people to make a new wallet or a whole separate account to make a proposal etc.
21:57:08 From  Kevin Frey  to  Everyone:
	Even if it‚Äôs not 100% right it‚Äôs ok. If one option is 70% right and the other 50% right then I think you‚Äôre absolutely right to take the 70%
21:57:24 From  Stephen Whitenstall  to  Everyone:

22:23:16 From  Peter Elfrink  to  Everyone:
	Just for context, this was how we did governance round 1
22:23:18 From  Peter Elfrink  to  Everyone:
	The mission will be open for 2 weeks to submit your proposal. The closing date is Sunday, October 2, 12 PM UTC. At the end of this period, there will be a public meeting where proposers can (optionally) introduce and elaborate on their proposals, and the community can discuss.
	After this, we aim for 2 additional weeks for the community to discuss and adapt submitted proposals. During this period there will be another public meeting to discuss the proposals.
	After all comments are frozen, we will select the top 2 or 3 proposals, based on community engagement, feedback, and rating as well as alignment with the rules and restrictions outlined above, and add them to the SingularityNET Voting Portal. We expect this may take another week.

	I agree with Fly. Since the intent is that we want to move forward and the proposers to build how we should do things. But if that is not informed by a retrospective, then it becomes less effective. Giving the proposers that information becomes more productive in my view
