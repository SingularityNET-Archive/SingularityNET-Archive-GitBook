# Documentation Automation

See Issue here - [https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/219](https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/219)



Created a template repo to automate deploying a folder that receives markdown file updates.

The repo uses GitHub pages, GitHub actions and [just-the-docs](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/) to deploy any updates made to the docs folder in this repo.

After creating a new repo using this template, you need to make a few minor updates to get it working. All info found in README.md or in deployed doc page itself
