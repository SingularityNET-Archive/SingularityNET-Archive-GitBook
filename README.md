## Welcome

SingularityNET-Archive contains a history of the activities of the SingularityNET Ambassador Program.&#x20;

## Our goal

Our goal is to provide a collaborative platform for the SingularityNET-Archive community to share knowledge, ideas, and best practices. We welcome contributions from anyone interested in SingularityNET, whether it's a new project, code example, or documentation.

## Documentation

We hope our GitBooks can help you on your journey to explore and innovate with AI.&#x20;

### Archives GitBook

This SingularityNET Archives GitBook (where you are currently located) provides a history of the SingularityNET Ambassador Program, by documenting the meetings of its WorkGroups and Guilds (the topic-based groups that members work in).

Note that in meeting summaries, "**Discord name= Archive name**": that is, we record individual people's involvement in meetings using their Discord names as far as we can. So if you want to search or query the Archives about a particular person, it's best to use their Discord name.

Thank you for visiting our GitBooks, and we look forward to your contributions!
